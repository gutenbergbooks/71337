<p class="ph2">MARY REGAN</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>THE WORLD SITS DOWN TOGETHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was opening night of the new bill at the Grand
Alcazar; and Clifford, as he waited alone at a little
table for his host, almost unconsciously searched
through the great restaurant of black-and-gold for
Mary Regan—just as, almost unconsciously, he
had been seeking her wherever he had been during
the six months of agreed-upon silence since they
had parted. He did not expect to see her here,
hence felt no disappointment when his roving eyes
did not come upon her. She had said she would
write when she had thought it all out, and when she
was ready to see him. Six months was a long time,
but he believed in her word—and still waited, not
once having sought to penetrate that utter privacy
which she had asserted to be for her, at that time,
life’s prime essential. But though keeping his word,
he had often been impatient, and had often wondered.</p>

<p>Meditatively Clifford glanced over this great
crowd of well-dressed diners. For him they were a
vivid concentration, a cross-section, of life: of life
as he, in his philosophy, and in the pursuit of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
profession, had come to see it. Here were millionaires,
many of them having made their easeful
fortunes by dubious operations which shrewd counsel
had steered just within the law; here were young
men of moderate means, spending recklessly; here
were society women of the younger and smarter
set, with their escorts, sowing the seeds, though they
dreamed it not, of possible scandal and possible
blackmail; here were members of that breed of humans
who are known as “sporting men”; here were
the most finished types of professional crooks, many
accompanied by the finished women of their own
kind, but here and there with them a girl who had no
idea of the manner of man with whom she ate and
drank, and no idea of the end of this her pleasant
adventure; and here were respectable mothers and
their daughters, who were innocent of what sat at
the next table; and here were out-of-town visitors
who were visibly excited and exalted by the thought
that they were seeing life—New York!—the real
New York!</p>

<p>Clifford smiled sadly, rather grimly, to himself.
These conglomerate guests were proof of what he
had long held: that there was no distinct underworld,
no distinct upperworld; that in ideas and
personalities the two were always merging. This
scene summarized what experience had made the
basic idea of Clifford’s working philosophy: the great
interrelation, the great interdependence, the great
<i>oneness</i> of all humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>Looking over this mixture of all sorts, in which
acquaintance was so easy to make, Clifford thought
of the strange dramas that had their beginnings in
the Grand Alcazar and establishments of its kind.
Thus much had the dancing craze, though now receded
from its earliest frenzy, and the practice of
dining and eating midnight suppers in the showy
restaurants, achieved: it had brought all sorts of
persons, so long as they were well dressed, under the
same roof and had set them down at the same or
adjoining tables. Hardly since time began had that
important requisite of great drama been so nearly
perfect as in these restaurants—for people of different
ideas and interests and moral standards to meet
naturally upon a common ground....</p>

<p>A little man, swart of face, his mustache tightly
waxed, and in the smartest evening dress that convention
permits the male, paused and spoke to Clifford—a
gentleman whom most of the patrons of
the place knew, if they knew him at all, as Monsieur
Le Bain. Though the master of this ornate pleasure
palace, he spoke obsequiously.</p>

<p>Clifford liked to see the great little man squirm.
“Police trouble you much here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, Bob,—I never see a policeman here, except
when a captain or an inspector comes in to eat,” the
great restaurateur said nervously.</p>

<p>“Not like the old days downtown—with their
raids—eh, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of that sort—ever!” And with a quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
look around that showed he feared some one might
have overheard these sentences and guessed what
lay behind them, he said something about being
needed on his ballroom floor and hurried away.</p>

<p>Clifford watched the famous restaurateur, again
smiling grimly. If these people here—the respectable
ones at least—knew the record of Joe Gordon
(which again was not the name given him at birth),
knew from what places and occupations he had
made his way to his eminence of foremost host and
impresario of prandial entertainment—what a
panic there would be! (Or would there be a panic?)
Life was certainly strange!—with its emergencies,
its juxtapositions, its crossing of threads—strange
at least to him who was always seeing behind the
scenes. Yes, life was certainly strange!...</p>

<p>Clifford’s meditations were interrupted by a
hearty, “Hello, Bob,” and by a large hand gripping
one of his.</p>

<p>“Hello, Uncle George. I’d begun to think—”</p>

<p>“Hold on, son,” and Clifford’s host halted the
talk by raising one hand like a traffic policeman and
with the other reaching for the dinner card. While
the long order was being dictated, Clifford gazed
impatiently across at his companion, wondering
what this appointment was about. His host was a
large man who once might have been bulbous, but
who now had deflated little balloons of skin hanging
beneath eyes and chin and jaws. His few short
gray hairs were divided into two precisely equal portions;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
his eyebrows were entirely gone, and of eyelashes
he had almost none; his eyes were smallish,
gray, cunning, genial. He made Clifford fancy, with
those eyes of his so good-naturedly cynical, and with
his large, outstanding ears, that here might be a
satyr who had forsaken gay forests for city and had
at length grown into grandfatherly days.</p>

<p>“Well, now, Uncle George—what’s all this
about?” Clifford demanded when the order was in.</p>

<p>“Not so fast, son,—not so fast,” slowly remonstrated
Uncle George, who, as far as Broadway’s
knowledge went, was no one’s Uncle George, but
who was known by no other name. “Let’s wait until
we’ve packed away some of the freight that waiter’s
going to bring us.” He blinked his lashless lids, and
drawled on. “It’s been a long time since I’ve seen
you—six months. I just wanted to give you the once
over, and ask you how was trade.”</p>

<p>“Trade’s good—considering.”</p>

<p>The old head nodded. “Yes, considering that
you’re a detective who’s on the square. There’s not
much chance for that sort, son,—not in this here
widely advertised Christian civilization of ours. At
least, not much chance to make a large private collection
of coin.”</p>

<p>“I’m not in this primarily to make money. I
thought you understood that.”</p>

<p>“You sure are a queer guy, son,” pronounced the
old man. “I’ve heard you spiel off your ideas—you’re
not primarily a thief-taker—you’re in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
to help people out of the trouble. A hell of an idea
for a detective!”</p>

<p>“You know as well as I do, Uncle George, that
most of the people that get into trouble, or seem to
be bad—well, they personally are not so much to
blame. They’ve been born and raised in bad conditions—they’ve
never had a chance—have never
really been able to tell what was right or wrong,
and have never had a chance to choose the right—”</p>

<p>“Come up for air, son,—come up for air,” cut in
the old man. “Son, that’s nice music, but it’s all
bunk. You’re an awful example of what a college
education can do to a man. Now you just listen to
your Uncle George. You know me—everybody
knows me. I’ve been in about every crooked game
known to the human race and the higher animals,
including managing shows—and I’ve never been
pinched because I was too clever for the coppers, and
the coppers know it, too. I tell you I know life up
and down and across the middle—and I tell you
that we’ve all got a streak of crookedness—every
damned one of us!”</p>

<p>“If that’s so,” smiled Clifford, “then why are you
always helping crooks?”</p>

<p>“That’s just my human cussedness. I’ve retired
from business—I’m one of these gentlemen farmers
that have located on Broadway; but I don’t like to
see any earnest young crook get a raw deal from the
coppers, who are the rawest crooks of all.” The old
man waved his left hand as though brushing such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
conversation aside. “But let’s get down to brass
tacks—which means you and me. You and Bradley
as great friends as ever?”</p>

<p>Despite himself Clifford flushed with chagrin.
“Don’t try to be funny!”</p>

<p>“And, son, don’t be too sore. Bradley was one
hell of a guy. He was the cleverest chief of detectives
the Police Department ever had.”</p>

<p>“And the crookedest!”</p>

<p>“Sure, son,—didn’t I tell you us humans were
all crooks!” the old man said appeasingly. “But,
sure, there never was a crookeder chief of detectives
than Bradley. You certainly showed nerve when
you started out to get him—and you certainly
showed your class when you finally trapped him,
publicly, with the goods on. Only—”</p>

<p>“That’s it—<i>only</i>!” Clifford exclaimed sourly.
“It’s quite some little word, that <i>only</i>.”</p>

<p>“Sure—<i>only</i>. Son,”—and the old man spoke
gravely,—“I’m twice as old as you are, but you
should know as well as I know that <i>you really can’t
get</i> a copper. I mean a clever copper. Count the big
coppers that have really been sent away—the smart
boys, I mean—and you’ll see you have several
fingers left to check up your laundry on. That was
grand business you pulled on Bradley, and it showed
all New York he was a crook. It was worth doing—God,
yes! But I said to myself, as soon as I heard
of the swell arrest you had made of him, that a
classy guy like Bradley would have himself covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
and would beat the case when it came to trial. And
he sure did beat it!”</p>

<p>“On a technicality!” Clifford was still bitter at
the manner in which his old enemy and old superior
officer had slipped from what had seemed the sure
clutches of the law.</p>

<p>“A technicality, sure. But it got him off, and what
more does a crook ever ask for?”</p>

<p>“But he got reinstated in the Police Department!”</p>

<p>“But didn’t he retire right afterwards, claiming
broken health? And don’t you and I know his real
reason was that his old game was done for and that
the public was wise to him? The big trouble with
you, son,” the old man declared severely, “is that
you want a one hundred per cent victory. The best
you can hope for with a guy like Bradley is to split
the thing fifty-fifty.”</p>

<p>“You seem to admire Bradley a lot!” half growled
Clifford.</p>

<p>“I do. I hand it to the guy with brains wherever
I meet him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can be friends with me, then!”</p>

<p>“You’re clever, too, son. You’re the only one I’ve
ever figured might beat Bradley in a finish fight. And
then you’re a queer party, Bob,—you’re square,”
he drawled. “I’ve traveled up and down this world
of he-and-she grafters, shoplifters, safeblowers, and
sure-thing business men, and after it all you know
it’s right pleasant to sit down in the shade of a square
guy. And besides, son,” he added, “I said I admired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Bradley because he was clever; I didn’t say
I liked him as a friend. Now, you, Bob, somehow I
like you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Uncle George.” There was a moment’s
silence. “But that’s not what you got me here to
tell me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, son. But what’s the hurry? Queer,
ain’t it,” he meditated, “how all the big cops, when
they leave the Police Department, open a private detective
agency? I hear Bradley’s doing great business
since he started out as a private detective.”</p>

<p>“Licensed blackmailer—that’s what he is!”</p>

<p>“Sure, son, that’s what they all are. A client tells
a private sleuth secrets, and retains him to get information
about some other party—and is held up
for a big fee. The sleuth gets the information, and
then makes the second party pay by threatening
to expose him—second hold-up; and then makes
the first client pay again by threatening to expose
the original secret—third hold-up. Oh, it’s a rich
game Bradley’s switched into!”</p>

<p>“Once more, Uncle George—that’s not what you
got me here to tell me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s not really so much I’ve got to tell
you. Mebbe it’s occurred to you”—meditatively,
slowly—“that since the big upset you gave him,
Bradley isn’t exactly what you might call in love
with you.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly.”</p>

<p>“Well, I heard it from a friend who’s got a friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
who’s got a mother-in-law who listens to little birds—and
the dope runs that Bradley is out to square
matters with you.”</p>

<p>Clifford nodded. He had expected something of
the sort.</p>

<p>“Did this little bird relay any information as to
just what Bradley was going to do?”</p>

<p>“None that got to me. But, son, I’d keep my eyes
pointed in all directions, and be careful of the friends
I made, and be careful of the cases I got drawn into.
It may be a long time coming, and God only knows
in what direction it’ll come from. Bradley knows
how to handle people so they never know they’re
being handled—and he’s likely to hit you through
almost any one. Look out, son. This is serious.
There’ll be big doings.”</p>

<p>Clifford gazed steadily at the old worldling. Indeed,
there must be something—and big!—or
else Uncle George, whose general attitude in matters
of morals, police, and criminals was one of genial
<i>laissez-faire</i>, would not have brought him this warning.
He knew from experience the craft and power
of Bradley—his subtle patience in working out his
designs, his patience in waiting apparently quiescent
for the ripe moment—the swiftness and might with
which he struck when the instant came to strike.</p>

<p>Automatically, swiftly, Clifford’s mind flashed
forward in search of possible weapons, of direct and
devious schemes, that the fertile-brained Bradley
might be contriving against him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>THE RETURN OF MARY REGAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Suddenly</span> all conjectures concerning Bradley were
swept utterly from his mind. Down the gilded red-carpeted
stairway that led from what the Grand
Alcazar termed its “ballroom de luxe,” there came—though
this was not the figure Clifford first noted—a
short, full-bodied, ornately dressed man, with
a bald crown and a smile of engaging amiability.
Beside him, and a half-head taller,—and this is
what Clifford first saw,—walked a slender young
woman, in an evening coat of rose velvet, her
rounded throat gleaming a dusky marble from the
soft shadows of the furred collar. Her face was the
rose-tan of early autumn leaves, and her dark eyes
gazed straight before her with a composure so complete
that it seemed to announce a haughty indifference
to all the world.</p>

<p>“Mary Regan!” ejaculated Clifford, stupefied.</p>

<p>Uncle George seemed not the least startled by Clifford’s
exclamation. He turned—and then there was
surprise enough in his voice:—</p>

<p>“Hello—Peter Loveman with her!”</p>

<p>Clifford, recovered from his brief paralysis, arose
and hurried between the tables. But the pair had
already turned into the entrance and did not note<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
him. As Clifford came into the gilded and bepalmed
lobby, he saw her, aided by four eager Grand Alcazar
flunkeys and by Loveman, looking a grotesquely
small grand opera impresario in his silk hat and fur
coat, stepping into a closed car. By running Clifford
could have caught her, or by calling he could have
gained her attention. But at that instant he remembered
the essence of their bargain, that he
should make no attempt to seek her out until she
sent for him. That remembrance checked him; the
door closed upon the rose-velvet figure, the car slid
off through Broadway’s incandescent brilliance, and
she was gone.</p>

<p>Forgetful of where he was, Clifford stood bare-headed
and stockstill in the lobby. Mary Regan’s
sudden reappearance out of the silence, the vacancy,
of six months’ absence, sent his mind flashing over
the past, the present, the future, touching in chaotic
wonderment the high spots of his strange relationship
with her.... Daughter of that one-time famous
cynic and famous master criminal, “Gentleman
Jim” Regan, dead these five years, she had
passed her girlhood in the cynical philosophy of the
little court surrounding her father,—had made that
philosophy her own,—and, grown into young
womanhood, she had joined that great crime <i>entrepreneur</i>,
her Uncle Joe Russell, in many of his more
subtle enterprises. It was at the beginning of this
career that Clifford’s life had come into contact with
hers. Police Commissioner Thorne had ordered him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
to “cover” the pair. From the first Clifford had conceived
the idea that her criminal point of view was
not an expression of her true nature, but was a habit
of mind developed in her by association: and he had
proceeded upon the theory that a bigger rôle, than
merely to make arrests, would be to arouse the real
Mary Regan to her true self.... The conflicts between
the two!—her hostility to him!—his ultimate
success, or seeming success, when he had broken
through her shell of defensive cynicism—and last
of all, that parting scene down in Washington Square
in the dusk of the on-coming dawn!...</p>

<p>He lived through that scene for a briefest moment—he
was always living over that scene. He
had told her that he loved her; and she, admitting
that she loved him, had said, “But that doesn’t
mean I can marry you.” “Then, what does it
mean?” he had demanded. A look of decision
had come into her face—how vividly he recalled
every minutia of their one love-scene!—and she
had said:—</p>

<p>“Before we can talk definitely about such things,
I want to go off somewhere, alone, and think over
what you have said about me. If I am not what I
used to be—if I am really that different person you
say I am, I want to get acquainted with myself. I
seem so strange to myself, it all seems so strange.
I hope you are right—but I must be sure—very
sure—and so I am going away.”</p>

<p>“But when you come back?” he had cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“A lot may happen before that,” she had answered
gravely. “A lot to you, and a lot to me.”</p>

<p>“But when you come back?” he had insisted.</p>

<p>“When I come back,” she had breathed quaveringly,
“if you still think the same way about my
being that sort of person—and if I find that it’s
really true—”</p>

<p>And then his arms had closed about her and he had
kissed her. But even as she had let him, she had
murmured almost fearfully: “Remember—a lot—may
happen—before then....”</p>

<p>Clifford’s mind leaped forward from that long-gone
night to the present. And now she was back—back
out of the unknown into which she had disappeared—and
back without having sent him a
word of any kind! What did it mean, this unannounced
return? And what did it mean, her being
in company with dapper little Peter Loveman?—man-about-town,
and carrying behind that round,
amiable smile the shrewdest legal brain of its variety
in New York.</p>

<p>Clifford had in reality been standing in the gilded
lobby for no more than a minute, though his mind
had traversed so wide a space, when a gray-and-black
town-car, with a long hood that suggested
power ample for a racer, slowed down at the curb
and a young man stepped out and hurried into the
Grand Alcazar. Fifth Avenue tailors and hatters
and haberdashers had equipped him with their best
and costliest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Sink my ship if it’s not old Bob Clifford!” he
cried, giving Clifford a slender, soft hand. “How’s
the old boy?”</p>

<p>“Same as always. And how’s Jackie Morton?
You’ve been missing for months.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a wonderful tale to unfold—but no time
to unfold it now.”</p>

<p>There was that about him which begot an instant
liking, though his face was not as strong as it might
have been.</p>

<p>“Say—you won’t believe it—but listen. I’ve
been on the wagon for seventeen weeks!”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Give you my word! Not a drop in seventeen
ages! Had to, you know. My old man—say, he’s
one old battleship!—steamed into New York and
shut off supplies, and said unless I cut it all out
and took a brace, there’d be no more shipments
of munitions. Get the situation, don’t you?—case
of a sixteen-inch gun shoved into my face and bein’
told it would go off if I didn’t reform. So look and behold
and observe what’s happened—I’m reformed!
Been off where milk’s all they shove ’cross the bar—isolated,
and all that kind of thing—and been
behavin’ in a way to make the Ten Commandments
jealous. Honest to God, Clifford—”</p>

<p>Abruptly he checked this effervescence. “Say,
seen Peter Loveman about here?”</p>

<p>“He’s just gone.”</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“I believe there was a young lady with him,” Clifford
replied discreetly—wondering a little what
young Morton’s business, if any, could be with the
pair that had left.</p>

<p>Morton hesitated; then again was effervescent.
“Was to have met him here—but there’s no tellin’
where he is. Come on—let’s have a drink.”</p>

<p>“But you are on the wagon.”</p>

<p>“I am. But I want to give you the grand sight of
watchin’ me fall off.”</p>

<p>“You sit tight right where you are,” advised
Clifford.</p>

<p>“Now, come on, don’t block traffic with a funeral,”
pleaded the young fellow, slipping an arm through
Clifford’s. “Just one drink!” Clifford shock his
head; and Morton tried to draw him into the restaurant.
“Just one little drink, Clifford,—one little
drink after a Sahara of milk!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Morton!” a deep, brusque voice called from
behind them.</p>

<p>They turned. A man, square of shoulders and
deep of chest and with square, forceful face, was
advancing toward them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Clifford,” he said.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bradley,” Clifford returned, trying to
speak calmly—and for the briefest space these old
enemies, who had so often been at grips, stared at
each other, with hard, masked gazes.</p>

<p>Bradley turned to Clifford’s companion. “So
you tried to give me the slip, Mr. Morton. I heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
what you suggested to Clifford. But I guess you are
keeping off the booze to-night.”</p>

<p>“Just look this large person over, Clifford,”
mourned the young fellow; “and honest, ain’t it
hell, my father wishing a party like Bradley on me
for a nurse!”</p>

<p>“You need one all right!” Bradley said grimly.</p>

<p>“But even babies get let alone for an hour now
and then,” protested the other.</p>

<p>“You forget that the size of my check from your
father depends upon my keeping you and booze
apart.”</p>

<p>Morton sighed. “You’re a sordid person, Bradley.”</p>

<p>“I might mention incidentally,” continued Bradley,
“that your father has just come to town.”</p>

<p>“The devil!” Morton’s face filled with dismay.
“I guess, then, it really is good-night, Clifford.”
He took Bradley’s arm. “Come on, nursie; let’s
hail the captain of my perambulator.”</p>

<p>Clifford watched the two go out, and again he had
the sense that he was glimpsing into the complicated
maze behind the brilliant surface of Big Pleasure.
The relationship between that pair might be
strange for any other period in the world’s history,
but it was a definite, though small, phase of this
great pleasure life—a gay young spender bridled
and the reins put in the hands of a private officer.
Clifford felt a moment’s uneasiness for young Morton:
in what ways could Bradley not twist his client<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and protégé into predicaments that would bring
him profit?</p>

<p>When Clifford regained his table, Uncle George
regarded him with amazement. “I thought you had
gone!”</p>

<p>“Gone where?”</p>

<p>“With or after Miss Regan.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I thought you were—well, I guess you get me.
That being the case, I didn’t think you’d pass up
the chance to be with her.”</p>

<p>Clifford hesitated, then spoke the truth: “The
last time I saw Mary Regan, I promised not to speak
to her until she sent for me.”</p>

<p>“And it was your promise that stopped you?”
Uncle George asked incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You poor simp! I suppose you thought she’d
be thinking of you, only you, with you out of her
sight for six months—and that then there’d come
a sweet little message like them they flash on the
movie screens!”</p>

<p>Clifford did not reply. Uncle George had very
nearly expressed his thought.</p>

<p>“No woman ever lived that could keep thinking
of one man for six months, and him away!” Uncle
George leaned closer, and spoke in a low voice. “See
here, son,—while you’ve been keeping your promise
and remaining strictly off the premises, what do you
think the other people have been doing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“What other people?” cried Clifford, in quick
alarm.</p>

<p>Uncle George ignored the question. “You think
you’ve been an influence upon her. Mebbe so, son.
Mebbe so. But she was twenty, and two or three
more, before you ever saw her. Don’t you think
those twenty years might have some influence with
her, too?”</p>

<p>“What other people?” repeated Clifford.</p>

<p>Again Uncle George ignored the question. He
looked at Clifford keenly, and spoke slowly.</p>

<p>“’While ago you asked me why I wanted to meet
you here. Well, son, my chief reason was because
I knew Mary Regan was going to be here—and
because I thought, on seeing her, you’d wade right
into the situation.”</p>

<p>“See here, George, what do you know?” Clifford
cried sharply.</p>

<p>“Mighty little that’s definite,—and telling you
that would be giving people away, and that’s against
my principles,—and, besides, the little I know
might only be misleading. But, son,”—the old
man’s voice was grave,—“if you’re at all interested
in that girl, you sure ought to be busy. And
that’s all I can say.”</p>

<p>Abruptly Clifford stood up. “Thanks, Uncle
George,—good-bye—” And he was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>PETER LOVEMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Clifford’s</span> first business was to make up for the
opportunity he had just let slip, and find Mary
Regan. At once he decided that his best source of
information was her brother, “Slant-Face,” once
a pickpocket of amazing skill, now the manager of
a little motion-picture house. He turned uptown to
Slant-Face’s theater.</p>

<p>On the way he was feverishly alive with questions.
Clifford’s thoughts had really not been off
Mary Regan from the moment he had seen her come
down the stairway; and now Uncle George’s vague
warning—he knew Uncle George would not have
spoken even so indefinitely unless there existed a
very real situation—banished all else from his mind.
Why hadn’t Mary Regan sent him word? What was
behind her return in such a manner? What decision
had she come to in regard to herself during these
months? What decision in regard to him?</p>

<p>And this danger that Uncle George had hinted at—did
it rise chiefly from the plans and influence
of other persons? And who might these other persons
be? And what might be the danger? Or might the
danger rise partly out of the complexities, the contradictions,
of her own nature?—that nature which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
always so baffled and eluded him. But the doubt
which lay behind this last question seemed disloyal,
and he forcibly drove it from his mind. Mary Regan,
he emphatically told himself, was the woman he
had believed her to be! She could explain everything.
Whatever might be wrong was due to the
unknown other persons.</p>

<p>Slant-Face’s theater, though the hour was only
ten, was dark. He hurried to Slant-Face’s apartment;
but Slant-Face was not there, and his wife
knew nothing of his whereabouts. Downtown again,
Clifford began a tour of Slant-Face’s hang-outs; and
at length he found him standing alone at the end of
the Knickerbocker bar, before him a glass of buttermilk—a
slender, smartly dressed person, whose
immobile, lean face was given a saturnine cast by
the downward slant of the left corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>“I saw your theater was closed, Slant-Face,” said
Clifford. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Bradley.”</p>

<p>“Bradley! How could he have anything to do
with closing your theater?”</p>

<p>“Bradley hasn’t forgot my little part in your
stunt that got him out of the Department. He just
waited—and laid his plans. While films were being
run off and the house was dark, he had pockets picked
in my place, or had people say their pockets were
picked—pulled this three times. What with my
reputation, this was enough for the Commissioner
of Licenses, and he closed my joint.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“That’s pretty rank. Bradley certainly does have
a long memory—and a long arm!”</p>

<p>“This is a five-reel picture, and it’s not all been
run off yet,” half growled Slant-Face through his
thin lips. “In the last reel, some one is going to get
him!” He sipped his buttermilk, then abruptly:
“Clifford, because of what you’ve done for me, I’ve
played it straight for a year. The straight game
don’t pay—not for me. So I’m through. I guess
you understand what comes next.”</p>

<p>“See here, Slant-Face, don’t be—”</p>

<p>“I’m through!” There was the snap of absolute
finality in the low, quiet voice.</p>

<p>Clifford knew that mere words could not change
the decision made behind that lean, grim visage; so
he turned to the matter that had brought him there.</p>

<p>“Have you seen your sister to-day?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen Mary in six months.”</p>

<p>“You mean you don’t know where she’s staying?”
exclaimed Clifford.</p>

<p>“Down South in the woods somewhere,—God
knows why,—doing a stretch of self-imposed solitary.”</p>

<p>The obviously honest answer sharpened Clifford’s
already poignant uneasiness. “Slant-Face, I saw her
an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“In New York?”</p>

<p>“At the Grand Alcazar.” And then he added:
“She was with Peter Loveman.”</p>

<p>Even the stoic Slant-Face started. “With Peter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Loveman!—the lawyer that beat Bradley’s case
for him! What the devil does that mean?”</p>

<p>“Just what I’m wondering myself.”</p>

<p>“You mean you didn’t ask her anything—didn’t
speak to her?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Slant-Face looked his bewilderment. He had had
his own private guess at what had been the situation
between Clifford and his sister. But he did not
ask the “why” of this to him strange behaviour on
Clifford’s part.</p>

<p>“Mary with Peter Loveman!” he repeated.
“Either Mary is trying to put something across—in
the old way, you understand; or else she’s—well,
it looks like queer doings to me!”</p>

<p>“That’s why I looked you up. Some one should
step in, and stop what’s under way. I supposed
you knew where she was.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to begin to try to find out,” said
Slant-Face. “And you?”</p>

<p>“Same here. By the way, would your Uncle Joe
know anything?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know? He’s sold out everything
here and bought himself a fruit farm in California.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s just one man we’re certain does
know. That’s Loveman, and I’m going after Loveman.
Let me know if you get next to anything,
Slant-Face. So-long.”</p>

<p>Clifford and the once master pickpocket clasped
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“And Slant-Face,” Clifford added, “about that
other matter—getting money in the old way.
Don’t do it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not promising,” said Slant-Face quietly.</p>

<p>Clifford privately asked Police Commissioner
Thorne to help in locating Mary Regan. Also he
hunted up little Lieutenant Jimmie Kelly, one hundred
and twenty pounds of grit and daring, head of
the Tenderloin Squad that free-lanced through the
hotels, restaurants, and resorts of Broadway, and of
Jimmie he asked the same help. He himself, for two
days and nights, now and then seeing Uncle George
and Slant-Face, trailed Peter Loveman from office to
courts and back again—and particularly about the
restaurants and theaters and after-theater theaters,
which comprised Loveman’s especial habitat.</p>

<p>But not again did Clifford see Loveman with
Mary Regan. The second night, however, he did see
Loveman with young Morton, and with the two
a middle-aged man with a masterful face. Morton’s
father, Clifford guessed.</p>

<p>And yet, though he saw nothing, all his senses
assured him with growing insistence that great
forces were at their hidden work—those subtle, complex
forces that operate indirectly, patiently, with
infinite cunning, behind the alluring and often innocent
visage of brilliant Big Pleasure. And also he had
a growing sense that this was not primarily a detective’s
puzzle; but primarily a matter of the eternal
human mystery of how human beings react, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
how they may be artfully stimulated. He felt himself
just a human being in the midst of a human problem
whose outlines he could not yet discern.</p>

<p>On the third day of failure it came to Clifford that
there was a chance—a bare chance—that Loveman
had no design involving Mary Regan, and he
decided to go openly to him. At Loveman’s lavish
downtown offices he was told Loveman had telephoned
he would not appear that morning. Twenty
minutes later Clifford, after having sent in his card
by the Japanese butler-valet, was in Loveman’s
study. The room, the studio of an apartment designed
for an artist, was furnished with a disordered
luxury and culture which Clifford knew to be
a genuine characteristic of the strange little notable
on whom he waited. Here were rows and rows of first
editions; old Dutch etchings, among them several
original Rembrandts; a helter-skelter gallery of autographed
photographs of favorite actresses. For a
score of years, as Clifford knew, Loveman had not
missed an important first night.</p>

<p>Whatever might be the outcome of this interview,
Clifford knew that sometime, somehow, between
him and Loveman there would be a conflict of wits.
So he looked swiftly and curiously around the room,
for concerning this room there were current many
fables. This study, and not the downtown office, was
said to be Loveman’s real workshop. Here were
created those astute plans, in which the influence
of Loveman was never traceable, that brought to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
downtown office those big-fee’d domestic cases, to
be fought brilliantly and sensationally in the courts
or to be settled discreetly in private. He was New
York’s ablest representative of a type of lawyer that
modern social conditions have produced: a specialist
in domestic affairs—and one, when profitable dissension
or threatening scandal did not exist, who
knew how to create such. It was gossiped that he
kept a careful record of all tangled relations among
the rich, of the details of every delicate situation,
and watched and bided his time until at length the
affair threatened to explode into a scandal—and
then he acted. In this study there was a huge
“Scandal File,” so gossip had it; but Clifford, looking
about, saw no such fabled article of furniture.</p>

<p>At that moment Loveman entered, his tonsured
head and rope-girdled dressing-gown giving him
the appearance of a somewhat jolly and rakish
monk.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Clifford,” he exclaimed, cordially
holding out his hand. “Mightily like a Christian of
you, looking an old tramp up.”</p>

<p>“They told me at your office that you were sick.”</p>

<p>Loveman waved Clifford into a chair, took one
himself and crossed his small, exquisitely slippered
feet. “That’s what I told the office, but I didn’t tell
’em what sort of sickness it was. My boy,”—with
a frank, engaging grin, which was one of the many
qualities that made this strange man so popular,—“do
you perceive any adequate excuse for a man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
my supposedly sensible years starting in at 11.30
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on a mixed-drink Marathon?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say,” smiled Clifford, “without a knowledge
of the prior—”</p>

<p>“Don’t be legally cautious with an incautious
lawyer. There was no excuse.” Loveman shook his
round head solemnly. “There was provocation,
though. You bet there was provocation. Were you
at the opening last night of ‘Orange Blossoms’?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Congratulations. It’s a dam’ rotten show! And
Nina Cordova—she’s all there off the stage, pretty,
and clever, and one wise little girl, don’t you forget
it!—but a dam’ rotten star and the voice of a guinea-hen
that’s got the quinsy. And it cost sixty thousand
dollars to get the curtain up last night, and I
put up twenty thousand dollars of that boodle. Tell
me, oh, why”—with a quaver of mock self-sympathy—“am
I always going out of my own line and
letting myself be played as a sucker by some manager
or actress that wants extra backing? Twenty
thousand honest-to-God dollars! I kissed ’em good-bye
the very minute Nina first opened that dam’
pretty mouth, and her first note rasped across the
footlights! Ain’t I the boob!”</p>

<p>Clifford smiled at the grotesquely disconsolate
figure, but did not answer; he knew no answer was
expected. But while he smiled, waiting, part of his
brain was remarking that these seemingly reckless
ventures of Loveman were in truth sound investments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
on which, by the devious methods of his art,
he later realized sumptuously. That twenty thousand,
which would make the vain Nina regard him
as her disinterested friend and adviser, wasn’t
money thrown away—not in view of the whispered
affair between the voiceless prima donna, and—</p>

<p>“Why should I be blowing my roll,” continued
Loveman, “on these dam’ musical comedies—<i>musical</i>,
say there’s some irony for you!—when what I’d
have liked would have been to help back a show like
‘Justice.’ Or the Russian ballet. Nijinsky—there’s
some artist for you!” His last words were vividly
sincere; there was nothing more sincere about the
little man than his admiration for the highest endeavors
in art. “And yet my coin goes into ‘Orange
Blossoms’! Is there an artistic Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde?—there is, and I’m the party—and that’s
why my stomach, esophagus, palate, tongue, mouth,
and all appertaining thereunto, are this <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> composed
of a faded and dusty Brussels carpet. But,
my boy, you didn’t come here to listen to my woes.
What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>His humorously bewailing manner had suddenly
dropped from him; he was brisk and alert, and his
over-large eyes were fixed upon Clifford keenly. Clifford
knew that there was little chance of deceiving
this holder of the threads of destiny in a direct encounter.</p>

<p>“I came here, Loveman, to ask you for the address
of Mary Regan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Loveman looked puzzled. “Mary Regan—do I
know her?”</p>

<p>Was there something behind this evasion? “You
remember her if you remember getting Bradley off.
She was in that case.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I remember: slender—dark—handsome.
But I haven’t seen her since the trial.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to call you anything, Loveman,—but
I was told you were recently seen with her in
public.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At the Grand Alcazar—for dinner—three
nights ago.”</p>

<p>Loveman smiled. “You’ve caught me. I own
up. But my fib was a gentleman’s lie.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t want it known that she was in New
York.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Search me. Perhaps just a girl’s whim.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where I can find her?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t the slightest idea. I was with her more or
less by accident. I was taking care of her merely for
a couple of hours—substituting for a friend of hers.”</p>

<p>Clifford felt sure the little man was lying; but he
also felt sure he could get out of Loveman nothing
Loveman preferred not to tell. All the brains of the
Bar Association had not been able to do this when
Loveman had been before that body on charges of
unprofessional conduct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“By the by, Clifford, what’s your interest in the
young lady?”</p>

<p>“Her family heard she was back, and engaged me
to locate her.”</p>

<p>Loveman, looking keenly at Clifford, did not betray
whether or not he recognized this as prevarication.
Clifford stood up.</p>

<p>“Well, as you were my only clue, I might as well
give the matter up. Sorry to have bothered you.
Good-morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll find her—you have the reputation of
doing whatever you start out to do. Don’t hurry
away. I’ve got some new first editions I want to
show you. But pardon me for just a moment.” He
scratched a line upon a sheet of paper, rang, and
handed the folded sheet to the Japanese butler, who
silently withdrew. “Now!” he cried briskly, and began
to talk enthusiastically over half a dozen stained
and musty volumes.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the noiseless butler appeared,
bearing a card. Loveman begged Clifford to excuse
him, and withdrew—to reënter in five minutes.</p>

<p>“Something rather curious has just happened, Clifford.
A gentleman with whom I’ve had some dealings
just called—I had an inspiration—I made a
suggestion, and— Well, let him speak for himself.
Come right in!”</p>

<p>At this, through the door Loveman had left open,
stepped the square, solid figure of Bradley.</p>

<p>“I believe you two are acquainted with each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
other,” remarked Loveman with his amiable briskness.</p>

<p>The two men nodded, and for a moment stood
silent. Clifford tried to read Bradley’s purpose, but
Bradley’s powerful face, with its small, brilliant
eyes, was as controlled and reticent as in the days,
now over a year gone, when Bradley used to give
him orders at Police Headquarters.</p>

<p>“H’are you, Clifford.” The voice was the same
even, heavy bass.</p>

<p>“First-class, Bradley.”</p>

<p>“Chairs, gentlemen,” put in Loveman; and when
they were seated: “Shall I say it, Bradley, or will
you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll say it.” Without preface, or reference to the
past, Bradley was in the midst of things. “I’m
building up a big business, Clifford. Another year or
so, and it’ll be the biggest private detective agency
in the country. It’s already getting too big for one
man to manage; besides, there are certain kinds of
cases that another man can handle better than I can.
I’ve been looking over the field for the right man.
Clifford, I’ve decided you’re this right man, and I
want to ask you if you’d be willing to go into partnership.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak yet—think it over for a minute,”
put in Loveman. “You two have had your little
differences, but it ought to be plain to both of you
that there’s more in it for you two working together
than fighting each other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Clifford managed to maintain a composed exterior,
but within he was bewilderment. Certainly
Bradley was a most amazing man!</p>

<p>Clifford thought swiftly, if somewhat dazedly.
Was this a trap? It might be—probably was, in
view of what had previously passed between them.</p>

<p>But then again—it might not be a trap. Bradley’s
offer, on the face of it, was a good business
proposition, advantageous to both parties. It was
a commonplace of business and politics and police
affairs, that competitors and even deadly enemies
may scratch the past off the books and combine in a
common effort when they vision a profit sufficiently
large in such a procedure.</p>

<p>And profit there certainly would be in Bradley’s
proposition—big profit. First, would be the original
profit of the large fees which clients would pay to
have information secured for them. And second,—if
the agency were to be run as most other private
detective agencies, and on this Bradley would doubtless
insist,—there would be the usual large profits
secured through the pleasant and easy device of
blackmailing clients by threatening to reveal to the
public the scandals they had been paid privately to
uncover and corroborate. Beyond a doubt, tremendous
profits!</p>

<p>Yes, it might not be a trap. It might be just a
plain business proposition. It might be—</p>

<p>Another thought: It might be a bribe!</p>

<p>Yes, whatever else it might be, it also was certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
a bribe. But to buy him away from what?... From
what?...</p>

<p>“It’s a good proposition—yes?” prompted Loveman.</p>

<p>Though Clifford had taken time to think, his decision
had been made the very moment he had understood
Bradley’s proposition.</p>

<p>“As you say, Bradley, there’s big money in it,
and it’s a great chance for the right party. I want
to thank you for considering me and offering me
the chance. But I never expect to build up a big
business, and such cases as I do take on I want to
handle personally and in my own way.”</p>

<p>Bradley’s square face showed not the slightest
change. “That’s your privilege, to do things the
way you like. Glad I spoke to you about it, though.”</p>

<p>“That’s another good inspiration I had that’s
gone on the rocks,” humorously complained Loveman—“as
bum a guesser here as when I backed
Nina Cordova in ‘Orange Blossoms.’” He followed
Clifford to the door, a hand upon his arm. “Anyhow,
I may want to be shoving some business your
way.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Clifford nodded to Bradley, and Bradley
nodded back, his face the same grim mask as
ever.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>AS MARY SEES HERSELF</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Clifford went out it seemed to him, for the moment,
that his efforts thus far had resulted only in
bringing him into contact with affairs far removed
from his main business. But the next moment experience
reminded him that nothing in life was irrelevant.
Might not these seemingly unrelated fragments
be revealed as closely articulated parts of a
great drama of life whose working-out lay in the
unvisioned future?</p>

<p>Anyhow, he had new questions to put to himself.
What was behind Loveman’s suave statement that
he knew nothing of Mary Regan? And what behind
Bradley’s offer of partnership? They meant something:
and the more Clifford thought, the more was
he convinced that Loveman was in whatever business
might be brewing; and since Loveman was in it,
it was safely and adroitly based upon the weakness,
vanity, or ambition of our common human nature.</p>

<p>The sense, though he had little definite basis for it,
that Mary was vitally concerned in this impenetrable
business, that she was perhaps the chief victim
of its hidden workings and of its dangers, grew
in Clifford with every moment. He simply had to
find her!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>Hoping against hope, Clifford daily expected a
note from Mary Regan—for he could not wholly
discount her promise—but no note came. And
though Uncle George, Slant-Face, and Lieutenant
Jimmie Kelly, in their divers manners, were all looking
for Mary, none during the next four days reported
a trace of her. Nor did Commissioner Thorne,
with his larger resources, turn up a single clue. She
seemed to have vanished utterly.</p>

<p>All these days Clifford himself kept doggedly to
the tedious routine of centering his personal endeavors
upon Peter Loveman—following that dapper
gentleman from home to office, to court-rooms,
to restaurants on Broadway or the Avenue for his
substitute for afternoon tea, to his home again to
dress, then to the long evening’s schedule of pleasures—taking
rest only during the periods when
Loveman was held in court, or during the five hours
between three and 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> that Loveman allowed
himself for sleep.</p>

<p>On the seventh afternoon, while Loveman was
tied up in court, and while Clifford was spending an
hour at home, a note was delivered him by messenger.
It read:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">See me at headquarters at your earliest convenience.</div>

<div class="verseright"><span class="smcap">Thorne.</span></div>
</div></div>

<p>Clifford considered. Then he sent back the message,
“Will try to come at five.” It was now three
o’clock; Loveman would be out of court at half-past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
three or four. He had decided that the best
procedure was to follow Loveman from court to club
or restaurant, and then if the lawyer seemed settled,
as usually was the case, he could safely slip down
to Police Headquarters.</p>

<p>At four o’clock Clifford saw Loveman leave the
Criminal Courts Building and step into the closed
car he had seen Loveman and Mary Regan enter
seven nights earlier in front of the Grand Alcazar.
Clifford, at a discreet distance, followed in a taxi.
The big car, after twisting about through the region
of clubs and restaurants, deposited Loveman before
a great hotel on Fifth Avenue, The Grantham.
Clifford, following him in, saw Loveman address
the perfect young blonde who sat at a switchboard
within a grilled enclosure, wait while the blonde announced
his name through the telephone, then saw
him make for the elevators.</p>

<p>Clifford waited several minutes, then himself approached
the deity of the switchboard. “I want to
get in touch with Mr. Loveman at once, and I believe
he’s calling here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, on Mrs. Gardner—twelfth floor, Apartment
M. Shall I ’phone up you’re here?”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll not interrupt him. I’ll catch him
when he comes down.” The blonde, Clifford had at
once divined, was the sort not averse to talk. “I
wonder if this is the Mrs. Gardner I know,” he said
easily. “What’s she like?”</p>

<p>“Never really seen her,” returned the blonde.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
“Has all her meals in her suite. Goes out only at
night—about nine, when everything’s dead here—just
for an hour’s motor ride. She’s always in black,
and veiled. Guess she’s a widow.”</p>

<p>A little more chat and Clifford drifted into the
hotel bar, from which he could watch the elevators.
He sipped his Vichy with a casual, lounging air that
required his best acting. Could that Mrs. Gardner
be Mary Regan? And if she was Mary Regan, was
she also truly Mrs. Gardner?</p>

<p>Half an hour passed; then Loveman came out of
one of the elevators. Clifford had a moment’s fear
that the blonde would tell him that a caller had made
inquiry for him; but the blonde was answering the
questions of a guest and did not see Loveman go out.
Clifford allowed a few more minutes to pass, then he
approached the blonde’s cage with a brisk air.</p>

<p>“There’s something Mr. Loveman forgot to say
to Mrs. Gardner, and he asked me to come back
and tell her. Just say it’s Mr. Loveman calling
again.”</p>

<p>The girl spoke through the telephone as directed;
then, “You’re to go right up.”</p>

<p>Tingling with suspense, Clifford shot up to the
twelfth floor and rang the bell of Apartment M.
The door was promptly opened, and without waiting
for the maid to cry a warning because of this suddenly
altered Mr. Loveman, Clifford walked quickly
past her through a little hallway into a sitting-room.
At a window, looking down into the Avenue stood a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
slender figure in a gown of gold-brown chiffon velvet,
softly touched with fur. She was Mary Regan.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Mr. Loveman,” she said, not turning.
And then after a pause she added a bit impatiently,
but in that distant, composed tone she had so often
used toward him in other days: “Well, what else
is there? Haven’t I already promised to follow
your instructions in every detail?”</p>

<p>Clifford did not reply, and his silence caused her
to turn. At sight of him the tint of autumn rose
left her dark face.</p>

<p>“Mr. Clifford!” she breathed.</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon—” He hesitated; the last time
he had spoken to her, six months before, he had called
her Mary. “Good-afternoon, Miss Regan.”</p>

<p>And then the fear that was in him caused him
quickly to add, “Or should I say Mrs. Gardner?”</p>

<p>“I am still Mary Regan.” She moved nearer.
“You here! The name you sent up was Mr. Loveman.”</p>

<p>“I used Mr. Loveman’s name because I thought if
I sent my own you would refuse to see me.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>He had searched her out primarily to learn the
danger she was in and to save her from it, but here
he was in the first moment speaking of himself. “I
reasoned that you did not want to see me from the
fact that you have been in town a week and have
sent me no word. And I thought, after your promise—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>He could not finish. She motioned him to be seated,
herself took a chair, and there was a moment’s pause.
Pale, a strained composure in her face, she was wondrously
striking in the gold-brown velvet with its
margin of fur; she seemed to have matured, yet to
have grown no older; and never before had she
seemed more poignantly desirable to him. The old
questions that had haunted him for six months,
surged up and he was almost choked with the immanence
of the answer to them. Had there come
the change that they had talked about? Had she
reached the decision that he had so long been waiting
for?</p>

<p>At length she spoke, and the contralto warmth
and color of her voice were subdued to a neutral
monotone. “I could have sent you word,” she said.
“But I have no excuse to offer, and prefer not to
explain.”</p>

<p>“You know what I’ve been hoping for—and
waiting for,” he said with difficulty. “You have not
forgotten that last night in Washington Square?”</p>

<p>“No. And you have not forgotten the point I then
insisted upon—that I wanted to go off, alone, to
examine myself and try to learn whether I was
really the sort of woman you declared me to be.”</p>

<p>“I remember. And now that you have been away,
and come back?”</p>

<p>Her voice was steady. “I have learned I am not
that kind of woman.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“I have learned that I do not look upon life—that
is life for myself—in the way you thought I
would.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I know now that I am by nature more worldly
than you believed me.”</p>

<p>He grew suddenly sick at her even words. “I was
hoping that you would have decided that you cared
for me.”</p>

<p>“I am and always shall be grateful to you for the
things you did for me, and I shall always appreciate
your high opinion of the qualities you believed to
exist in me. You were kind and generous—and I
shall never forget.”</p>

<p>“But you have no other feeling—toward me?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Then this is final—as far as my hopes are concerned,”
he whispered dryly. He was dazed; too
dazed to note that she had grown even more pale
than a few moments before and that her hands were
gripping folds of the velvet gown.</p>

<p>Presently he tried to pull himself together. He
remembered the main purpose of his presence here.</p>

<p>“But at least you will let me help you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly—if I need you.”</p>

<p>He leaned closer. “You never needed me more
than now!”</p>

<p>“For what reason?”</p>

<p>“You are in danger—great danger!”</p>

<p>She started, and gazed at him with a sharp penetration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
which even at that moment struck him as
peculiar. “In what danger?”</p>

<p>Her question took him back. In his intensity he
had forgotten that he knew so little that was definite.</p>

<p>“I thought you would know,” he confessed. And
then, with a ring of certainty, “If you do not know
yourself to be in danger, then why are you in hiding?”</p>

<p>She ignored his last sentence. “I am in no danger
of which I am conscious.”</p>

<p>He seized upon the one point he was certain of.
“But you have been seeing Peter Loveman. I hope
you are not letting him get control of your affairs.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Loveman has merely been giving me some
friendly advice. He is a very able lawyer.”</p>

<p>“There is no abler lawyer in New York than Peter
Loveman. But Peter Loveman cannot be trusted.”</p>

<p>“I am not trusting him—very far.” She spoke
with that supreme self-confidence that had always
characterized her. “And I believe I can take care of
myself.” This last she added coldly, yet not unkindly.</p>

<p>Clifford felt himself baffled. And then, suddenly,
he remembered another possible source of danger to
her—or at least of danger to that Mary Regan he
had believed her to be. Could she, as the worldly-wise
old Uncle George had suggested, have felt the
pull of old associations, old points of view, and have
reverted—</p>

<p>But even as he was thinking of this, she with her
remarkable keenness had read his mind. “Don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
worry about that. I have no intention of going back
to the sort of things I once tried to do, and you
stopped me from doing.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” he said simply. And then he
added, “But still I feel you are in some great vague
danger.”</p>

<p>“What?” she queried as before. “I am here of my
own choice. I go and come as I please. Whatever
I may now be doing I do of my own free will.”</p>

<p>“Then you have a plan?”</p>

<p>She was silent a long moment, all the while gazing
at him steadily. Then she replied, “I have.”</p>

<p>“May I ask what it is?”</p>

<p>“You have earned the right. As Robert Clifford,
the man, you might not approve of it. As Robert
Clifford, detective, you can find nothing wrong.
Beyond this I can tell you nothing—now.”</p>

<p>He felt shut out—placed at a far distance—and
felt the dizzy sickness once more come on him. He
had met her again, after long waiting, after long
search—and this was the poor ending of it all!</p>

<p>He saw her glance furtively at a gilded clock. Awkwardly
he arose.</p>

<p>“I’ve kept you too long,” he mumbled.</p>

<p>She made no polite denial, but also stood up. He
started out—and found he could not go.</p>

<p>He turned. “Please tell me two other things.
First, why are you in hiding?”</p>

<p>“That I must be excused from answering.”</p>

<p>“Is it part of your plan?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>She hesitated, then nodded.</p>

<p>“And your calling yourself Mrs. Gardner—is
that, too, a part of your plan?”</p>

<p>“Yes—to the extent that I am temporarily using
it to hide behind. Now you must go—please!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye—I won’t bother you any further.”</p>

<p>Sick, bewildered, and with as great a fear as when
he entered, Clifford started out. But at that moment
there was a ring at the doorbell.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you go before!” cried Mary; and
then, seizing his arm, “Wait, you mustn’t go now!”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“It would be misunderstood.”</p>

<p>“Then you know who that is?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is it Peter Loveman?”</p>

<p>“No.” Her dark eyes gazed at him very straight;
she spoke rapidly. “You are an old acquaintance—you
met me in Paris before the war broke out—that’s
all you really know about me. Except that
my name is Mary Regan.”</p>

<p>“I’ll play the part,” said Clifford.</p>

<p>“Sit there by the window.”</p>

<p>Clifford obeyed, more dazed than ever, and wonderingly
watched Mary. She stood in the middle of
the room, tensely composed. The maid had answered
the bell, and Clifford now heard a man’s voice in the
hall—a familiar voice. The next moment the visitor
was through the doorway, and Clifford beheld
that likable young man-about-town, Jack Morton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>But Jack Morton saw only Mary, and his face
flushed with delight. “Mary!” he cried and crossed
to her with open arms. Without hesitation she
stepped forward and her lips met his.</p>

<p>Clifford experienced such a swift onrush of dizziness
and sickness that he barely kept his seat.</p>

<p>After a moment Mary drew away from Morton.
“Jack, I want to introduce an old acquaintance to
you—Mr. Clifford.”</p>

<p>“Bob Clifford—you here!” cried Morton. “You
know Miss Regan?”</p>

<p>Clifford remembered his lines. “I met Miss Regan
in Paris before the outbreak of the war.”</p>

<p>Mary held her pale face steadily upon Clifford. “I
suppose, Jack, Mr. Clifford might as well know the
truth.”</p>

<p>“After what he’s seen I guess he knows it.”
Young Morton, a glowing smile on his pleasant face,
held out his hand. “Congratulate me, Bob!”</p>

<p>Clifford took the hand. “You—you are married?”</p>

<p>“We are going to be—as soon as it’s safe.”</p>

<p>“Safe?”</p>

<p>“You see my—”</p>

<p>“Mr. Clifford does not need to know that,” Mary
quickly interrupted.</p>

<p>“Why—” Clifford stared; gulped. “I did not
even know you were acquainted.”</p>

<p>“We were not, till three months ago.” Morton
grinned happily. He slipped his arm about Mary
and Mary allowed it to remain. “Remember my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
telling you the other night about my being away, far
from the madding crowd?—in a place where they
don’t raise a thing but isolation? Well, that’s where
I met Mary—at Pine Mountain Lodge. Wasn’t
that some coincidence, Bob?”</p>

<p>Clifford agreed that it was. He looked searchingly
at Mary; but her pale, proud face met his eyes with
a steadfast gaze that was blank of any offer to
apologize or explain.</p>

<p>“Here’s wishing you luck, Morton,” Clifford
said with a control that surprised himself. He gave
Mary Regan a look that was quite as composed as
her own. “And you, Miss Regan, I hope that all
your best dreams come true.”</p>

<p>He maintained his control until he had managed
a very decent exit. But out in the corridor, he leaned
against the wall, a very sick man, with ejaculations
and questions stabbing him through and through.
This, then, was what his long waiting had come to,
his hopes and his dreams of a different Mary Regan!
This affair with Jack Morton, a good enough fellow
of his sort, that was her plan!... Yes, but what lay
behind that plan?... And did she care for Morton?...
And why had she not frankly written him of her
purpose?... And Peter Loveman, where did Loveman
come in?... And Bradley, guide and protector
of young Morton, what might be Bradley’s part?...
And what kind of person, after these months, was
really behind that exterior which Mary Regan had
presented him?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>In bitter revulsion Clifford straightened up and
walked away. What she was, and what she was
doing, and what she had got herself in for, these matters
were now none of his affairs. For him Mary
Regan was a closed incident.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>CLIFFORD HAS A NEW PURPOSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Half</span> an hour later Clifford entered the octagonal
reception room at Police Headquarters and sent his
name in to Commissioner Thorne. Word came
back that Thorne was engaged and would be so for
half an hour; but in the meantime wouldn’t Clifford
visit about the building.</p>

<p>Clifford descended to the great corridor on the
main floor. Here he met captains and lieutenants
and first-grade detectives—old friends, with whom,
until the events that had sent him out of the Department,
he had worked for close upon a decade.
They treated him with a respect that, coming after
his scene with Mary Regan, was soothing to his
rasped spirit. The very surroundings, too, affected
him—begot in him a formless longing; in a way
it was like coming back to one’s home town.</p>

<p>Here, too, he ran into little Jimmie Kelly. With
Jimmie he descended to the pistol range in the subcellar,
and for half an hour they practiced with the
regulation police revolvers, which recoil like ancient
shotguns—their targets those little posters
seen everywhere, headed “Wanted for Murder,”
over the heart of the pictured fugitive an inch circle
of white paper to serve as bull’s-eye. And then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
they practiced with Jimmie’s pistol, a .25 automatic
so tiny that it could lie in a closed hand and not be
seen.</p>

<p>“Wish you were back here with us, Bob,” remarked
Jimmie when Clifford announced that he
was due up in the Chief’s office. “It would be great
stuff—working with you again!”</p>

<p>There was hearty sincerity in Jimmie’s voice; and
the vague longing begot by it was still upon Clifford
when at length he was seated beside Commissioner
Thorne’s desk.</p>

<p>“Clifford,” said the Commissioner briskly, his
lean, Scotch-Irish face alive with purpose, “I’m
going to lay all my cards, face up, on the table. I
asked you to meet me down here, instead of uptown,
for the sake of the effect on you. That’s
why I made you wait, and asked you to visit about.
I wanted you to feel the old tug of Headquarters.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ve felt it all right, Chief.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. Clifford, six months ago I asked
you to become Second Deputy Commissioner. For
your own reasons you refused. I hope you’ve
changed your mind, for I’m now again asking you
to take the place.”</p>

<p>To be Second Deputy Chief of New York’s Detective
Bureau!—Clifford felt a leaping thrill—a
swift reaction from the heaviness and bitterness
which had been upon him since his scene with Mary
Regan. He considered for a moment. The controlling
reason for his previous declination, his knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
that Mary Regan would refuse him if he continued
official police work because she believed she would
interfere with his career—this reason Mary Regan
herself had just wiped out. He had lost enough because
of her. Here was big work to do. Here was a
big career.</p>

<p>Clifford looked up. “I accept, Chief,” he said
with an energy almost fierce. “And I’m glad and
proud to accept. And I’ll give the job the best
that’s in me.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you!” cried Thorne, seizing his hand.</p>

<p>There was a minute’s further exchange of thanks
and congratulations. Then Thorne continued:</p>

<p>“There’s a particular situation I want you to take
care of. I believe in the need of pleasure as much as
any man. But the providing of pleasure in this city
has become a vast business. I’m not referring to the
theaters; I’m thinking of the restaurants, roof-gardens,
dancing places, things like that—high and
low. And I’m thinking especially of the swellest
places, and of some of the presumably most respectable
places. These establishments have bred
a new variety of specialists, astute men, astute
women, who entangle and victimize the pleasure-seekers.
Especially since women began to go about
so freely to the dancing places, and it became so
easy to make acquaintances, there have developed
such opportunities—God, if the public only guessed
a tenth of what is dribbling in to us!—and even
we never get rumors of a tenth of what actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
happens. But you know this situation better than
I do.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had to learn something about it,” said Clifford.</p>

<p>“I want the facts. I want the situation cleaned
out. You’ve got a free hand—use as many men as
you like—follow your own plans.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be on the job at once,” said Clifford.</p>

<p>“Good stuff!” cried Thome enthusiastically.
“And if you succeed—and I know you will—it
will be a big thing for the Department, a big thing
for me, and we’ll try to make it a big thing for
you!”</p>

<p>This new interest so promptly and exactly fitted
the sudden emptiness in Clifford’s life that almost
without thinking he was impelled to ask, “Has anything
happened, Chief, to cause you to make me
this offer just now?”</p>

<p>Thorne regarded Clifford with a curious, thoughtful
air. “I wonder if I should tell you,” he said
slowly; and then: “Well, the fact is, Clifford, I have
been holding a little something back from you.”</p>

<p>“Something about what, Chief?”</p>

<p>“About you—and a woman.”</p>

<p>“Yes—go on!”</p>

<p>“Six months ago a young woman called on me
at my hotel, and asked me if I had offered you the
position of Chief of the Detective Bureau. I said
that I had, and that you had declined. She then
asked me if I still wanted you. I said yes, if I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
get you. That was all that passed between us. She
thanked me and went away.”</p>

<p>“She was Mary Regan,” said Clifford.</p>

<p>“She was.”</p>

<p>“And is that all that has happened?”</p>

<p>“To-day I had a note from her, without date or address,
advising me to offer you the position again, and
to keep on offering it to you until you accepted.”</p>

<p>Something was happening within Clifford, though
he did not know what it was—something that set
brain whirling and heart beating at a swifter tempo.
“I just left her,” he said with mechanical calm.
“She’s going to marry a man named Jack Morton.”</p>

<p>“So I have just learned.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Some of my men have been covering Bradley
and Loveman. Loveman’s house telephone is tapped,
and a few threads have been picked up. Miss Regan
believes she is doing what she is doing because she
wants to, and from her own motives. But Bradley
and Loveman are behind it.”</p>

<p>“In what way?” cried Clifford.</p>

<p>“Bradley, as you know, is a sort of private watchman
over young Morton. Loveman has handled a
lot of delicate matters for the father. The elder
Morton is a ruthless egoist, an able man of big
affairs, but remarkable for neither business nor
personal morality. The son you are acquainted
with. You can see the opportunities here for such
a combination as Bradley and Loveman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Yes. But where does Mary Regan come in?”</p>

<p>“Bradley and Loveman are using her now, and
expect to use her in the future.”</p>

<p>“Does she know she is being used?”</p>

<p>“I’m certain she does not even guess it.”</p>

<p>“Then how did they ever get her into it this
far?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“But surely,” cried Clifford, “You must have
some idea of what their plan is?”</p>

<p>“Only that I surmise that it is one individual case
of the general situation concerning which I just spoke
to you—about how very clever persons have made
a subtle business out of the manner in which the
city’s Big Pleasure reacts upon human ambitions
and human frailties. Any information more definite
than this it will be part of your job to get.”</p>

<p>Abruptly Clifford stood up and strode to a window
and stood gazing vacantly at a huge candy factory
across Broome Street—his whole being now wildly
athrob, his brain working swiftly though incoherently.
What might it not mean, Mary Regan’s showing
this concern to see that he accepted the position
he had once refused because of her?... And how
much did she really care for Morton?... And might
there not be motives, deeper and other than he had
guessed, that had caused her to treat him so cavalierly?...
And the menace of Loveman and of
Bradley—</p>

<p>Abruptly Clifford turned about on Thorne.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
“Chief, I’m sorry to take back my word—but I
cannot accept that job as Chief of Detectives.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” cried the astounded Thorne.</p>

<p>“That I can’t explain just now. But though I
can’t take the job, I’ll do all I can in a personal way
to help handle that condition you were speaking
about. You’ll excuse me, Chief, but I’ve got to do
a lot of quick thinking.”</p>

<p>Leaving Thorne fairly gasping at this swift transition,
Clifford strode out of the office and out of
Police Headquarters. Two minutes later he was in
a telephone booth in a saloon across the way and was
asking the Grantham Hotel, in which he had left
Mary Regan an hour before, for “Mrs. Gardner.”
Soon Mary’s cool, even voice sounded over the
wire.</p>

<p>“This is Robert Clifford,” he said. “May I see
you again—for just a few minutes?”</p>

<p>There was a long silence; then the cool voice
queried: “Alone?”</p>

<p>“If you please.”</p>

<p>Another silence. He was beginning to fear that
she had hung up, when the cool voice spoke again.</p>

<p>“Very well”—and this time he heard the receiver
click upon its hook.</p>

<p>He hurried for the Subway. He was athrill with
a grim elation. He felt that all that had thus far
passed between him and Mary Regan was no more
than a prelude—a long prelude, to be sure—and
that the big action of their drama lay still before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
them. He would fight on, still, for Mary Regan—to
save her from herself, to protect her from others!</p>

<p>But in this, his high moment, he had no prevision
of the vagaries of a woman’s nature he was to encounter—of
a willful, many-elemented woman who had
not yet found herself, and who had a long road yet
to travel before she reached that self-knowledge;
and he had no prevision of the strange places behind
the scenes of pleasure that his new purpose was to
cause him to penetrate, and no prevision of the
strange motives, the strange mixtures of human nature,
that he was to meet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>MARY SHOWS HER HAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Regan</span> stood in the dusk of her sitting-room,
holding apart the velvet hangings of a window, and
gazing far down at the quadruple line of motorcars
which at this twilight winter hour moves in
slow lockstep between Thirty-third and Fifty-ninth
Streets; and as she vacantly gazed upon the world’s
greatest parade of pleasure vehicles, part of her
mind was wondering about her approaching interview
with Clifford—and part of her mind, in
subconscious preparation for this meeting, was
automatically reviewing, and checking-up, and reswearing
allegiance to some of the decisions she
had reached concerning herself and the course she
had chosen. She was somewhat excited; but she felt
sure of herself—very sure!</p>

<p>During the six months she had been away, she had
studied, or believed she had, her own nature most
carefully, and also her immediate interests, and also
the bolder reachings of her ambition. She had considered
these matters, not sentimentally,—she hated
sentiment, she told herself,—but with cool brain,
and with no fear to admit the truth. To be sure there
had been a swift seizure and possession of her by
emotion when she and Clifford had kissed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
summer dawn long ago in Washington Square; and
now and again this emotional element had arisen in
her with appealing energy, but her cool intelligence
had always controlled such impulses. What did life
offer with a police official who was on the square?
Nothing! At least nothing that she cared for or
dreamed of. Honest police officials never got anywhere.
And as for Clifford, marriage with him would
ruin such career for him as might be possible. It
would never do—not for either of them.</p>

<p>What she wanted was altogether different. She
<i>knew</i>, for she had analyzed herself with the apartness
of a scientist. Her former attitude toward
crime, acquired through a girlhood spent with those
cynical gentlemen of the world, her father and her
Uncle Joe,—that attitude to be sure was now
changed; at least such intentions as formerly she
had had she now knew to be quiescent; Clifford had
influenced her to this extent. But though the criminal
impulses given her by her training were gone,
the worldly attitude and instincts begotten by that
training still remained. She believed herself a worldling;
and more, she believed herself a competent
worldling. She believed she had no illusions about
herself. The things in life that were worth while—so
in her confident youthfulness she decided—were
luxury, admiration, the pleasures that money could
buy. And these things she believed she could win.</p>

<p>This much, in her retreat, she had already decided
before Jack Morton had appeared in the quiet countryside.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
The coming of Jack, with the opportunities
represented by his amiable person, had made her
even more decided.</p>

<p>And so, as she now gazed down through the winter
dusk upon the shifting motor-tops, she was very
certain of herself despite her palpitant expectation
over Clifford’s coming—very confident of herself,
and what she was, and what she was going to do, and
what she was going to be: just as many another
young woman, of a perhaps more careful rearing,
was preeningly confident of herself, in those limousines
far below her. For this was the time of all
times, and the place of all places, that young women
were trained to dream of themselves; and here,
also, often the dreams came gorgeously true—for a
time!...</p>

<p>The ring of her apartment bell brought Mary
sharply from her thoughts. Switching on the lights,
she opened the door and admitted Clifford into her
sitting-room. She spoke first, with a formality that
held him at a distance.</p>

<p>“I consented to see you because an hour or two
ago you discovered a private matter of mine, and I
neglected to ask you to keep it silent.”</p>

<p>“You refer to your engagement to Jack Morton?”</p>

<p>“I do. Of course you will say nothing about it.”</p>

<p>“That you must leave to my discretion.”</p>

<p>“You mean you are going to tell?” she demanded.</p>

<p>He tried to keep his business here to the front of
his mind, but now, as he sat face to face with her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the old question recurred for which he seemed able
to reach no final answer: what was she really like
beneath this exterior she showed him?—what might
she be beneath and within the self she supposed herself
to be?</p>

<p>“I mean that I am reserving the right to do
exactly what I please,” he replied, looking at her
squarely. “This business of your secret engagement
is also what made me want to see you—but it is
only one of many things. I have done a lot of thinking
since I left you two hours ago. Also I have just
seen Police Commissioner Thorne.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Thorne honored me by offering me the position
of Chief of the Detective Bureau. I accepted
the position—”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose I should address you as— By
the way, just how should one address you?”</p>

<p>“But I immediately withdrew my acceptance,”
he continued, ignoring the cool irony which seemed
to come automatically into her voice whenever they
met. “I refused because of certain things I learned
from Thorne about you.”</p>

<p>“About me? What are they?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I want to learn more about—and
from you.”</p>

<p>“Ah—then you still are a detective?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I am,” still ignoring the irony of her
tone. “But just now I primarily am a person who
is interested in his own affairs as a man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Your affairs?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“Just now your affairs have become my affairs.
And I’m hoping that you’ll help me by frankly
answering my questions.”</p>

<p>“Questions about what?”</p>

<p>“About yourself.”</p>

<p>“Such as?”</p>

<p>“Instead of leaving it for me to discover by accident,
why did you not frankly tell me of your intention
to marry some one else?—when you knew
what for six months I had been hoping for. How
much do you care for Jack Morton?”</p>

<p>His determined face, and the flashing memories
of what he had tried to do for her, checked the
sharp replies that instinctively started for her lips.
The steady gaze of his intense eyes sent a warm
tremor through her, gave her a swift, tingling pleasure.
But that very pleasure was a warning to her:
such feeling in her was only aberration—the life
signs of some of her less important elements, which
she had adjudged to be a menace to her success and
which she must therefore suppress. The next moment
she had full control of herself—and she had
decided on what should be her course with him.</p>

<p>“You seem to regard me as a mystery,” she remarked
with tantalizing coolness.</p>

<p>“You are one—in a degree. And I want it
solved.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing in the least mysterious about
me,” she said in her even tone. “I’ll tell you all you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
need to know. You may be seated if you like.” And
after they were both in chairs: “First about Mr.
Morton. He is a pleasant, agreeable gentleman. He
has money and position.”</p>

<p>“You love him?”</p>

<p>“I like him.”</p>

<p>“You are marrying him, then, because it is a good
business proposition—to put it brutally.”</p>

<p>She met his flushed face calmly. “That is not
putting it brutally. Rather, it is merely putting it
honestly.” This she had decided must be made the
final interview between them. “I told you, when
you were here two hours ago, that I had discovered
that I am not at all the woman you believed lay
undeveloped in me. You may call me worldly—selfish—ambitious.
And you will be tremendously
right.”</p>

<p>He looked at her hard, and was silent a moment.
“But that isn’t answering my first question and all
it implied: why didn’t you write me before you returned
to New York? Why didn’t you frankly tell
me of your intended marriage?”</p>

<p>She lifted her shoulders ever so slightly. “It
must have been because I never thought of it.”</p>

<p>He flushed, but she met his look with unabashed
composure. She had lied, but she had lied easily,
for the lie had been carefully premeditated. When,
during her absence, her mind’s decision had gone
against Clifford, she had considered what would be
the most effective method of giving undebatable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
conclusion to the affair; and had decided upon this
course that she had followed. No need for letters—no
chance for sentimental pleading to alter her mind;
it would be all over, and ended, before he knew a
thing. Further, since the break had to come, it appealed
to her pride to seem superior and indifferent.</p>

<p>Clifford was angry, but he contained himself.
“To go on: was your meeting with Mr. Morton in
that out-of-the-way spot, Pine Mountain Lodge,
pure coincidence as he said?—or did cunning brains
bring it about?”</p>

<p>“You mean, my cunning brains?” Two spots of
conscious color appeared in her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I do not mean you. Did some one else, perhaps
without your knowledge at the time, plan that you
should meet?”</p>

<p>“What are you driving at?” she demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>“I don’t know myself yet—exactly.”</p>

<p>“Who could have planned our meeting? As you
know, I went to Pine Mountain Lodge to be alone.
Mr. Morton, not knowing of my presence there or
even of my existence, came to Pine Mountain to
rest up. We couldn’t help meeting, since the lodge
is the only place at which one can stay. That’s
all there is to this amazing mystery.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly all you see. But the coincidence
explanation doesn’t explain everything. Some one
may have been behind Jack Morton’s going.”</p>

<p>“Who? In what way? And for what reason?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Those are things to be found out.” He looked
at her steadily for a moment. “I asked you this
before, but I am going to ask it again: why are you
here in hiding?”</p>

<p>“After all, I guess I don’t mind telling you in the
least,” she returned coolly, with a sudden perverse
gratification in revealing what she knew he could
not like in her. Also she felt that here was another
detail by which she could make Clifford feel the
utter finality of the break between them. “Jack and
I came to New York intending to be married the
next day. But the very evening of the day we arrived,
Jack’s father unexpectedly came to town and
appeared at the Biltmore where Jack is staying.”</p>

<p>“Was that before or after the evening I saw you
at the Grand Alcazar with Mr. Loveman?”</p>

<p>“You saw me there the evening of the day of my
return. Jack was to have had dinner with me that
night,” she added, “and had reserved the table
and had asked his friend, Mr. Loveman, and then
he got tangled up with a friend and could not come.
It was that same evening that his father arrived in
town. I believe this is simple and clear.”</p>

<p>“As far as it goes. But why did you go into hiding?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that rather obvious?” she returned with
her cool frankness. “Jack and I were going to keep
our marriage secret—perhaps for a long time. The
appearance of his father, with the announcement
that he was going to stay with Jack, naturally delayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
our marriage. I insisted that it be postponed
until his father was away and there was no danger
of immediate discovery.”</p>

<p>“And Jack?”</p>

<p>“Jack was reckless. He was all for getting married
right away. But I refused to take the risk. Also,
under the circumstances, it didn’t seem particularly
wise to give the father a chance to find out
about me by our appearing openly together.”</p>

<p>“But you yourself could have gone out openly
alone, or with friends.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” she said dryly—“and have run
the risk of Jack and his father seeing me in public,
and learning all about me. No, thank you—the
only way for me has been to keep under cover for
the present.”</p>

<p>Clifford had felt a great start, but he had suppressed it;
and he managed to say quite casually:
“Of course Jack Morton doesn’t know who you
really are?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Oh, I don’t mind so much what
he might learn about me,” she added, a bit defiantly.
“You police have nothing on me—not in
the way of a conviction, anyhow. But it would not
help particularly if he learned who my father had
been, and that Joe Russell is my uncle, and that my
brother is Slant-Face Regan.”</p>

<p>“But he’ll be sure to learn some day.”</p>

<p>“By that time he’ll have become so attached to
me that it’ll not make much difference.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“But there’s his father. What about what’ll
happen when he finds out? All Jack’s money comes
through his father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, his father will come around in the end. You
see he’s not to know till we get ready.”</p>

<p>Clifford looked at her for a long moment of silence.</p>

<p>“I know what you’re thinking; you’re thinking
I’m just another adventuress,” she said with a
shrug. “But what of that? Every woman is an adventuress
who is trying to better her position and
who is using her head to do it. And that’s just what
every woman is doing!”</p>

<p>“I was not thinking chiefly of that; I was thinking
of Peter Loveman. Did he suggest that you go
into hiding?”</p>

<p>“When Jack told him of our engagement, he said
he didn’t want to know anything about it, he wanted
to keep out of any such affair. But when he learned
Jack’s father was in town, he telephoned me to keep
out of the way.”</p>

<p>“You’ve known Loveman some time?”</p>

<p>“Since I came back to America. He’s been Uncle
Joe’s lawyer; and naturally they’re friends.”</p>

<p>“And he could have known you were in Pine
Mountain Lodge?”</p>

<p>“Of course Uncle Joe might have told him.”</p>

<p>Clifford considered a moment. “Tell me, just
what has Mr. Loveman had to do with this affair?”</p>

<p>“I have already told you everything I know.”</p>

<p>Clifford was convinced that in this she was telling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
him the truth. But all his senses informed him that
somewhere, working in some manner, behind this
affair was Peter Loveman, playing with his master’s
subtlety upon human frailties, passions, and ambitions.
Undoubtedly Mary Regan was being used.
Undoubtedly also Commissioner Thorne had been
right when he had declared that Mary Regan had
no suspicion that she was being used, that she believed
that whatever she was doing she was doing
of her own free will.</p>

<p>He had put to her all the questions he had intended;
and as for a moment he sat gazing at her—so
composed, so worldly-looking, and so very young
to be saying such things as she had just said—the
more personal questions, which had shaken him so
often, throbbed through him like so many gigantic
and fiery pulse-beats: Was she through and through
and unchangeably this worldly, calculating Mary
Regan that she had so carefully depicted for him—or
was it all just a pose? Or might she believe herself
sincere in this sophistication—and yet deep
down in her might there be the living essence of a
very different Mary Regan that she tried to deny
and ignore? He could not forget that moment in
Washington Square when her soul had seemed unlocked;
he could not forget her kiss....</p>

<p>Clifford stood up as though his intention was to
leave. She also rose. His trifling strategy achieved
its end—physical proximity and the chance which
sitting at formal distance in chairs did not permit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Suddenly he gripped her two shoulder; and the
energy and purpose and feeling which he had kept in
restraint during the past minutes now burst forth.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Mary Regan,” he declared tensely.
“You are not going to marry Jack Morton! You
hear me!”</p>

<p>She was so startled at the change in him that she
was hardly aware of the hands clutching her shoulders.
“Why not?”</p>

<p>His words rushed out. “I’m not going to say anything
about it’s not being square. He’s not good
enough for you! Oh, I don’t mean to run down a
man I’ve called my friend. Jack Morton is pleasant
enough in his way. And you’ve seen him at his best—away
from the lights and Big Pleasure, when he
was on his good behavior—and there are few men
who can be more agreeable than Jack Morton. But
Broadway is likely to get hold of him again! And
girls!—no girl is pretty to him for more than six
months, and every pretty girl is prettier than the
last pretty girl! It’s just the way Jack is made—or
the way this town has made him. I tell you it’s an
awful mistake!”</p>

<p>“It’s my own mistake I’m making!” Her dark
eyes flashed at him. “Take off your hands!”</p>

<p>Instead he clutched her all the tighter. “There’s
a bigger reason than the mistake. Mary, you love
me!”</p>

<p>“Love you!” she ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Yes, you love me, and you know you love me!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
he declared masterfully. The impulse was upon
him to sweep her from her announced determination
by dominating her with a swift power comprised of
his own longing for her and her reawakened liking
for him. “You know you love me, or why did you
see Commissioner Thorne about me six months ago,
and why did you to-day suggest to him that he
again offer me the place of Chief of the Detective
Bureau? You love me, and you thought your marriage
to me might injure my public career. You
don’t care how much marriage to Jack Morton may
injure him. Don’t you think I see through you?
Don’t you think I understand? You’re not going to
marry Jack Morton! You’re going to marry me!”</p>

<p>She had paled—and her dark eyes, of a brown
that was almost a black, were fixed upon him widely,
in what might have been fear, or bewilderment, or
fascination, or all of these—and he felt a trembling
go through her body. For a long moment they stood
tensely thus: he hoping that he had carried the day—and
at the same time poignantly wondering what
she was about to say or do.</p>

<p>“You are going to marry me! You are going to
marry me!” he repeated after the manner of those
who seek to work miracles by the power of a forcefully
iterated idea.</p>

<p>He felt her body grow taut; and the startled look
of her face gave place to composed decision. That
moment he knew that he had lost—for this day at
least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Please remove your hands!” she commanded
in a quiet, edged voice.</p>

<p>He did not at once obey; his faculties were still
so engaged with his struggle to turn her aside, and
with his failure, that he scarcely heard her.</p>

<p>“Please remove your hands!” she repeated, her
voice not going up by so much as a semi-tone.</p>

<p>His hands fell to his sides.</p>

<p>“Despite what you say, Mr. Clifford,” she continued
in the same even voice of calm decision, “I
am not going to marry you, and I am going to marry
Mr. Morton.”</p>

<p>He was composed again. “Perhaps you may never
marry me,” he returned grimly. “But you certainly
will never marry Jack Morton.”</p>

<p>“And why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I shall prevent it.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“By any and whatever means seem most effective.”</p>

<p>Her gaze sharpened. Then the red of anger
faintly tinted the tawny satin of her cheek.</p>

<p>“You mean to say you would be low enough to
tell Jack or his father about me and my family?”</p>

<p>He looked her straight in the face. “You have
admitted that that procedure might be effective.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t dare do that!” And she seized
his arm with a grasp no less intense than his of a
minute before, and glared at him.</p>

<p>“I’ll do exactly what may be necessary, Miss
Regan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“You—you—” she gasped. “You have no right
to interfere in my affairs!”</p>

<p>“There is far more to this affair than just <i>You</i>,
Miss Regan.” With an almost impersonal movement
he removed her hand from his arm and let it fall.
“I must be going. But do not forget for a moment
that I am going to prevent your marriage, and prevent
it in whatever way will be most effective.”</p>

<p>He bowed slightly. Standing just where he had
left her, she watched him go out, within her a dazed
commotion of surprise, consternation, suspense—and,
strangely, not quite so high an anger toward
Clifford as she had felt two moments before.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>NINA CORDOVA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Yes</span>, he must prevent this marriage, he must block
Loveman, he must find out Loveman’s plan, and he
must do all quickly—but how? To warn the Mortons
would achieve some of these ends; but he had
a strong repugnance to this procedure. He would
only play this as his last card.</p>

<p>Clifford thought of Slant-Face; but he realized
that Slant-Face would probably have no influence
with his sister, and possibly the ex-pickpocket might
even regard the affair from Mary’s viewpoint. Also
he thought of her Uncle Joe; but the same objection
held true regarding him, and also the width of the
continent made him unavailable. As for Commissioner
Thorne, he could not be of service in the present
stage of affairs. And then Clifford thought of
Uncle George. Uncle George might possibly give
suggestions, for Uncle George knew as much about
the pleasure life (and what lay beneath it) of Broadway
and of Broadway’s closest territorial relative,
Fifth Avenue between the Waldorf and St. Patrick’s
Cathedral, as any other hundred men in New York
put together.</p>

<p>An hour after leaving Mary, Clifford sat in the
Grand Alcazar restaurant, looking into the bland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
genial, cunning, loose-skinned old face. He had just
finished telling Uncle George of his discovery of the
whereabouts of Mary Regan and the other events
of the day.</p>

<p>The old man regarded Clifford with meditative,
puckered gaze—a gaze of somewhat peculiar effect,
begotten by his lack of eyebrows and eyelashes.
“Son,” he began slowly, “the thing that stands out
in this chunk of <i>vers libre</i> you’ve been handing me,
is the fact that you’re so stuck on that little dame
Mary Regan—”</p>

<p>“Let’s leave me, and what I may think of her,
out of it,” put in Clifford.</p>

<p>“Don’t interrupt, son. You ask me a thing and
you’ve got to let me spiel along in my own way”—which,
indeed, was one of the difficulties not to be
avoided in consulting Uncle George. “Now, you
listen to me, son, and you’ll hear something out of
the original book out of which old Solomon and
those other wise guys that have been playing big
time steady for three or four thousand years swiped
all their good gags. Son, you’re too damned monogamous!
You’re insulting God: what the hell d’you
suppose he made so many pretty girls for?—and
let the others get wise on how to make themselves
pretty? Now, I like Mary Regan as well as any male
person can who’s not her relative and who’s not
trying to be—but if she tried any of that beautiful
female cussedness on me, I’d throw her one smiling
kiss, mail her a picture post-card of the jumping-off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
place, and proceed to admire some of the other works
of God.”</p>

<p>Uncle George nodded, and started to sip his white
wine thinned with sparkling water.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Uncle George. But let’s get back—”</p>

<p>“Hold on, son. That was just my first sentence.
Supposing Mary Regan is trying to put something
across by holding back a little of the truth—sort
of saving it up for a rainy day. Well, what of that?
Ain’t we all liars? You take it from your Uncle
George, a superannuated old burglar, president emeritus
of that grand old <i>alma mater</i>, the University
of Broadway, who’s played every kind of game with
every kind of male and female now decorating this
earth—take it from me, son, I’ve never seen the
strait and narrow road of truth congested with the
traffic. That’s one road you can speed on, and not
even see a cop. So, son, if Mary Regan has been like
the rest of us, don’t hold it especially against her.
And her marrying Jack Morton by holding back a bit
of the evidence, it’s not going to hurt him such a lot.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of what it may do to her.”</p>

<p>“Why, now, son, a marriage now and then seems
to improve a lot of women. And the only time a few
marriages seem to be a handicap to some women is
when they undertake to sign their names in full.”</p>

<p>“You’re in very good voice this evening, Uncle
George. But, if you don’t mind, let’s talk about
how to stop that marriage, and how to find out
Loveman’s game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“All right—all right. Now, let’s see. You know
Nina Cordova, star of that new musical show that’s
a sure-fire frost—what is it?”</p>

<p>“‘Orange Blossoms.’ Yes, I know of her.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll remember that in young Morton’s
previous Broadway incarnation he had an affair
with her—which little Nina broke off sharp and
sudden when she got the chance a year ago at the
star’s part in ‘The Bridal Wreath’? She’s a live
proposition: why not inject her into the affair?”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of that,” said Clifford.</p>

<p>“H’m. Well, then,” Uncle George meditated,
“you remember how Jack Morton, when he was
along here before, used to like his little quart or
two or three of champagne?—and how he behaved
when he was all lit up? Why not kidnap him from
Bradley, give him a chance to be his real self again,
and then ship him to Mary? This different Jack
Morton might make her stop and think. Or send
him along to his old man—and when his old man
saw how the kid had broken training he might do
what he’s threatened, stop Jack’s dough; and this
might be enough of a jolt to make Mary call the
thing off.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of those things, too.”</p>

<p>“You seem to have thought of everything,” half
grumbled Uncle George. “Well, what’s the matter
with these ways?”</p>

<p>“For one thing, it would take time to put them
across. I’ve got to act quickly, for there’s no telling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
what she’ll do. Besides, before I take any action, I’d
like to learn how she got into this matter; I’d like
to learn just what Loveman’s and Bradley’s part in
the game has been, just what they plan to make of
it in the future.”</p>

<p>“I get you,” nodded Uncle George. “So that
you can plan your action accordingly. But that’s
some job, son,—getting in on the inside of the game
of such a pair as Bradley and Loveman.”</p>

<p>“I know it. It can only be done indirectly.” Clifford
regarded Uncle George thoughtfully for a moment,
then suddenly asked: “Do you know Jack
Morton’s father?”</p>

<p>“I’ve met him.”</p>

<p>“Know him well enough to get into a friendly
talk with him?”</p>

<p>“Son,” demanded Uncle George in an aggrieved
tone, “you mean to insult me by asking if I need
even to have seen a man before to be his best friend
inside of thirty minutes—me that could go out
now and sell old Andy Carnegie’s pig-iron billets
back to him as gold-bricks!” Uncle George looked
at his watch. “Father Morton is staying at the
Biltmore. It’s now six-twenty. I’ve noticed that
he leads himself into the smoking-room at six-thirty
for a cocktail. I feel a craving for a Biltmore cocktail.
Son, just where is that building lot in North
River located that you want me to sell him?”</p>

<p>“Could you steer the talk around to his son—make
him doubt Bradley a bit—say something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
good about me—and implant in him the idea that
he ought to consult me?”</p>

<p>“Could I? Why don’t you write me an act
that’d bring out my talents? It’s already done—what
you going to do next?”</p>

<p>“That depends on whether Mr. Morton comes to
see me, and whether I get anything out of him.”</p>

<p>Uncle George heaved himself to his feet. “Come
on, son, see me safe aboard a taxi.” Outside, in the
cab, he reached forth and laid a hand on Clifford’s
shoulder. “Remember, son, there’s just as good
mermaids in the sea as have ever been caught.”</p>

<p>“<i>Bon voyage</i>,” said Clifford as the car started.</p>

<p>The old man, winking a genial, satyr-like wink,
blew Clifford a kiss through the open window.</p>

<p>At half-past ten that night Clifford sat at a little
table in the Gold Room at the Grantham. There
had come a message from Uncle George that he
should be in this room at this hour. Beyond this the
message had said nothing.</p>

<p>Clifford had wandered through the score of big
public rooms that comprised the first two floors of
the Grantham—the lounges, the parlors, the half-dozen
restaurants—with the feverish hope that he
might glimpse Mary Regan (so little effect had
Uncle George’s wisdom had upon him!), but with
no idea of what he should do or say should he see
her. He had had an impulse to call again at her
suite, but had restrained himself from that folly.
He now glanced through the slowly filling Gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Room, but he did not sight her. He wondered just
where she was—what she was thinking of—what
she was planning. Should he, if all other methods
failed, block her worldly plans and the as yet unpenetrated
scheme of Loveman and Bradley by telling
the Mortons who she was? He felt himself a
cad whenever he thought of it; but, yes, if he had to,
he would do it!...</p>

<p>A hand fell upon his shoulder. “Wake up there,
you old crystal-gazer!” called a cheerful voice.</p>

<p>Clifford looked up. Smiling down on him was a
cherubic face: a somewhat elderly cherub, to be sure,
since where usually there is the adornment of divine
curls there was the glaze of baldness.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Loveman, and join me in a drink.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of you, my boy,” answered the famous
little lawyer. “You might put poison in my
cup.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I lied to you—you see, I’m not waiting
to be accused,” the other smiled affably. “I
told you I didn’t know where Mary Regan was,
and after that you followed me and I led you right
to her. She telephoned me about your finding her.
You sure caught me dead to rights.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t do anything with you, Loveman,—though
that was the second fib you told me
about her.”</p>

<p>“Both gentleman’s lies—told for a lady’s sake,”
amiably explained Loveman. “She didn’t want her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
whereabouts known. But now that you’ve found
her, what’re you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I can do anything.” And then
Clifford chanced a shot. “You see, I learned that
she is secretly engaged to Jack Morton.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” exclaimed the little man. “That
is astounding! Well, well—I’ll have a look into
that and see what’s to be done.”</p>

<p>He rubbed his shining crown in bewildered
thoughtfulness,—Clifford had to admire his art
as an actor,—then again was smiling.</p>

<p>“Wish you’d join me after a while at supper, Clifford.
Little party I’m giving Nina Cordova—got
to cheer her up a bit, you understand. You know
‘Orange Blossoms’ is one God-awful flivver, and
Nina, poor orphan-child, don’t know what to do.
Gee, but it’s a rotten show, and what it didn’t
do to kill itself Nina did for it: she sure is one musical-comedy
prima donna that ought to be seen and
not heard! And even at that, seen too oft, familiar
with her face—oh, go ask the box-office man to
finish the quotation. So I’m giving her this little
party to boost her spirits—though why shouldn’t
somebody be giving me a party to cheer me up
for the twenty thousand United States of America
dollars that dropped through the bottom of that
show?” He gave a moan of mock self-sympathy.
“Well, you’ll join us when the crowd blows in?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I’m waiting for a friend.”</p>

<p>“Break away if you can; be glad to have you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Clifford watched the strange little notable, behind
whose light chatter he knew to be the cleverest legal
brain of its sort in New York, cross to a small corner
table, which was reserved for him every night and
was known to the waiters here as “Mr. Loveman’s
table.” He saw Loveman converse in turn with
various people, and in a general way he understood;
for at this table, during the play hours of the night,
Loveman transacted many of the affairs too delicate
to be brought to his office or his apartment. And he
saw Loveman, while he chatted, gaze about upon
those gathering for supper and dancing. There were
people here whose family names were daily in the
society and Wall Street columns—most of them
here with no intent more reprehensible than the restless
search for pleasure, which in this our present
day has become public pleasure. Loveman smiled
on them most kindly: as why shouldn’t he, thought
Clifford, since many of them were working for him,
though they guessed it not?</p>

<p>Loveman’s party now arrived and were seating
themselves at a large table directly beside the dancing-floor.
There were Jack Morton, his father, Nina
Cordova, two other actresses, and half a dozen men
and women of the smart young society set. Loveman
was at his best, keeping his party in highest
spirits: no man in New York was his superior as midnight
host.</p>

<p>As Clifford watched the gay supper progress, he
wondered what other of these guests the gay Loveman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
might be deftly drawing into some distant
entanglement.</p>

<p>Presently some one took the chair opposite Clifford.
It was Uncle George; and Uncle George gave
him a slight wink of a lashless eye.</p>

<p>“While we’re on the subject, son,” the old man
began, “I might remark that I put a bee in little
Nina’s bonnet.”</p>

<p>“Just what have you got me here for?” demanded
Clifford.</p>

<p>“It’s always worth while, son, to watch Loveman
improve each midnight hour. See how he smiles and
talks—and yet, God, how he’s working! But you’re
here, son, because of Father Morton; and also, perhaps,
to see if Nina’s bee buzzes. How about splitting
fifty-fifty on a ham sandwich?”</p>

<p>As the two ate the best supper Uncle George
could order, Clifford kept his eyes on Loveman’s
party. They were now leaving the table in couples
to dance. Nina Cordova, a slender blonde with a
soft, appealing face and quick, bright eye, was with
Jack Morton; dancing was something they both did
well; and it was easy to see that the slender prima
donna had more than a dancing interest in her partner.
Then Loveman danced with her; and in the
middle of the dance they halted beside Clifford’s
table.</p>

<p>“Finish this with me, Uncle George,” coaxed the
little star.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” returned the old man, “if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
you’d spoken to me a little earlier, say bout 1871,
I’d have danced with you till that orchestra dropped
dead. But now, why, I’d just fall apart on the floor.
Ask Clifford there.”</p>

<p>She smiled at Clifford and the next moment he
was fox-trotting with her. She was certainly a marvel
of a dancer; also, beneath her <i>ingénue</i> surface, she
had a keen brain of her own sort; and in her light
chatter as they swung about he sensed that she was
trying to search his mind—and he sensed also that
she was doing this at the instigation of Loveman.
But he parried so well that he believed she did not
even know he was fencing.</p>

<p>“Clever girl, Uncle George,” he said when he was
back at his table.</p>

<p>“Son, you said something then,” affirmed the old
man. “Unless my hunch works wrong you’ll some
day find her mixed up in this affair; and when you do
meet up with her, son, you’d better forget that,
according to the date written down in her press-agent’s
Bible, that dear little child is only twenty-one.”</p>

<p>Clifford looked over at her thoughtfully. She
danced half a dozen dances with Jack Morton; and
Clifford, watching everything, guessed that the
elder Morton was none too pleased. And then she
danced again with Loveman; and he saw that she
was talking imperiously to the little lawyer; and if
only he could have overheard he might have given
more weight to Uncle George’s prediction that Nina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Cordova was to play some considerable part before
the final curtain fell.</p>

<p>“Peter,” she was saying, “since ‘Orange Blossoms’
is such a fizzle, I’m going to quit the show business,
and marry some nice young man.”</p>

<p>“But, my child, your art!” protested Loveman.</p>

<p>“My art be damned!” replied the pretty one.
“And, Peter, I’ve decided that the nice young man
will be Jack Morton.”</p>

<p>Loveman gave her a sharp look. But if he felt any
alarm, his voice gave no evidence of it.</p>

<p>“Better think again, dearie. He’ll not have forgotten
the way you threw him down.”</p>

<p>“Give me a week and I’ll make him forget it,” she
returned confidently.</p>

<p>“If you are set on getting married, Nina dear,
I’ll help you find another candidate,” said Loveman
in his soft, advisory tone. “This town’s full of
rich young fellows. Just look ’em over, make your
choice, and I’ll help you out with the rest.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any other!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Jack Morton will do, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I think, dearie, that there are other arrangements—”</p>

<p>“You mean that you have other arrangements!”
she said sharply.</p>

<p>“There now, dearie, don’t get excited. This town’s
full of nice men—”</p>

<p>“You can’t bluff me, Peter! I see through you—you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
don’t want me to marry Jack.” The little
<i>ingénue</i> was suddenly a little fury—but a composed
fury. “Peter, I know a lot,” she said quietly, “and
unless you behave about the way I want you to, I
may do something that won’t make you awfully
happy.”</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the threat in that voice,
and that threat was not to be underrated. Loveman
had no intention of yielding; the situation required
careful handling and perhaps quick action
elsewhere; in the meantime the thing to do was to
temporize.</p>

<p>“All right, dearie,—we’ll fix it up,” he said soothingly.
“There’s Jack Morton waiting for us; I’ll
turn you right over to him.”</p>

<p>As Clifford saw Nina and young Morton begin
a fox-trot, a passing waiter handed Clifford a card.
On it was engraved, “<i>Mr. James Morton</i>,” and
around the name was scribbled, “Wait for me in the
lounge just off the bar.”</p>

<p>Clifford descended to the Grantham’s lounge,
which was fitted in the manner of the smartest and
most exclusive of men’s clubs. Five minutes later
Mr. Morton entered and came straight to him. Clifford
had already made his private estimate of this
man with the graying hair and distinguished face:
a man whose habit it was to buy men,—and women,
too,—use them, and when finished with them,
throw them aside without a thought and go on his
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“I’ve heard of you, Mr. Clifford,” he began, when
they were seated in deep chairs beside a little table.
“They say you are a detective who’s absolutely on
the square.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Clifford.</p>

<p>“I didn’t call you down to pay you compliments,”
the other said incisively, eyeing him keenly, “so I’ll
go right to the point. You know my son?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It’s about Jack I want to see you.” Mr. Morton
spoke in the compact sentences of a master of affairs.
“I guess you know he’s been some trouble. I’m
certain something’s in the air now. I don’t know
whether it’s that Miss Cordova or something else.
I can’t get anything out of Jack. I’ve been having
him looked over by a private detective; you know
him—Bradley; but Bradley doesn’t seem to be
able to learn anything either. I’m not one hundred
per cent trustful of Bradley: set a detective to catch
a detective—that might prove a good idea. Will
you undertake the job?—finding out about Bradley,
and finding out about my son?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say until I know the situation.” Here was
opening before him the chance he had been working
for, but Clifford managed to speak composedly.
“If you don’t mind telling me, just how do things
stand?”</p>

<p>“If you know Jack, you know what his idea of
living in New York was a year or six months ago.
I couldn’t leave my affairs and come here to look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
after him. I ordered my lawyer, Mr. Loveman, to
take whatever steps were necessary. It was absolutely
essential that Jack should take a brace—”</p>

<p>“Pardon me. Aside from the moral reasons, were
there any other reasons for your wanting Jack to
change his habits?”</p>

<p>“There was, and still is, an engagement with a
young woman back in Chicago. Not exactly an
engagement, rather an understanding between the
families. The match could not be more desirable;
the young lady has everything.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me—do I know the young lady you refer to?”</p>

<p>“You may have heard of her. Her father is Sherwood
Jones. She is Miss Maisie Jones.”</p>

<p>“I have seen her picture in the illustrated Sunday
supplements—among prominent young society
girls.”</p>

<p>“Then you can partially understand why I consider
the match so desirable. But the family at
that time objected, and still objects—until Jack
proves that he has settled down. Three months ago
I came East and delivered an ultimatum.”</p>

<p>“In the presence of Jack alone?” Clifford put in
gently.</p>

<p>“No. Mr. Loveman had been doing his best to
control the boy. Naturally he was present.”</p>

<p>“And the ultimatum?”</p>

<p>“I said that he either had to take a brace or I
was through with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“Let’s see whether I get the general idea.” Clifford
was moving forward carefully. “If Jack didn’t
brace up, he’d have to earn his own money. On the
other hand, if he did brace up, the idea was that he
was to quit New York and marry the young lady
you have referred to.”</p>

<p>“That’s it exactly.”</p>

<p>“Did you suggest any particular plan for his
bracing up?”</p>

<p>“I said he had to spend a period at some quiet
place far away from New York.”</p>

<p>“And what did Mr. Loveman think of this
idea?”</p>

<p>“He thought it was just the plan. In fact he
said he knew the very place for Jack to go to—Pine
Mountain Lodge.”</p>

<p>“Then he suggested Pine Mountain Lodge?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Clifford was silent a moment.</p>

<p>“You have told Mr. Loveman and Mr. Bradley of
your intention to consult me?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I suggest that you do not. Is there any other
information you can give me?”</p>

<p>“Nothing else that’s definite. But I suspect a lot,
and I want to find out what’s doing. Will you take
the case?”</p>

<p>Clifford spoke guardedly, masking his dislike for
the ruthless man before him. “I prefer not to consider
myself retained by you until I am certain I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
serve you. I’ll have to think the situation over, and
let you know later.”</p>

<p>It was little that Mr. Morton had told Clifford,
yet, after Morton had left him, that little set Clifford’s
mind going like a racer. He sat thinking—thinking;
and after a time he began to perceive dim
outlines of what Loveman’s plan might be. And as
with growing excitement he began to see, he began
also to consider what his own course should be....</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. It was half-past three.
He started back for the Gold Room, but on the way
up he saw Loveman and his party leaving. He
quickly secured his coat and hat and followed them
out just in time to see Loveman go off in a taxi with
Nina Cordova. He was after them in another taxi,
a discreet block behind. Five minutes later Loveman
set Miss Cordova down at her hotel, and went
on to his own home.</p>

<p>Clifford dismissed his taxi, waited ten minutes,
then crossed and entered Loveman’s apartment
house.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>IN LOVEMAN’S LIBRARY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> drowsy elevator boy carried Clifford to the
eleventh floor, and Clifford rang Loveman’s bell.
After a moment the door was opened by Loveman’s
Japanese butler, to whom Clifford, after stepping in,
gave his card. The little Oriental, showing no slightest
surprise at a call at such an hour, disappeared
noiselessly through a door; and reappeared after a
brief delay and held the door open as a sign that
Clifford was to enter.</p>

<p>Clifford stepped through the doorway and found
himself in the large richly furnished library of Peter
Loveman. Loveman, in a rope-girdled dressing-gown
and with his tonsured head looking very much a
jolly little monk, crossed the room with smiling hospitality.
In a deep, tapestried chair, wearing a dinner
jacket, sat the square figure of Bradley.</p>

<p>“This is a surprise, Clifford!” cried Loveman, taking
his hand. “And a pleasure, too,—also a relief:
dropping in on a pair of grouches, just as they were
getting ready to murder each other to drive dull care
away. You there, you other grouch,”—to Bradley,—“say
good-evening to our relief expedition.”</p>

<p>Bradley, without rising, nodded curtly. Clifford
gave back a similar greeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Off with your overcoat, Clifford,” the little man
said briskly, “and make yourself comfortable.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep it on, Loveman. I can only stay a few
minutes.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, sit down,” and Loveman pushed
him into a chair and gestured toward a little table on
which stood bottles and glasses and siphons. “All the
ingredients here of the Fountain of Perpetual Youth:
what’ll you have—high-ball, cocktail, liqueur—or
shall I have Oni bring you a split of champagne?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I’m not drinking to-night.”</p>

<p>“Smoke, then?” offering cigars and cigarettes.</p>

<p>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Say, you’re making a host look dam’ inhospitable,”
humorously complained the little man. “How
about a little whist? I’ll run the dummy. Bradley
there loves it: he’s acting vice-chairman of the
Daughters of Brooklyn Memorial and Bridge Associ—”</p>

<p>“Cut it out!” growled Bradley. “Ask him what
he wants.”</p>

<p>“Pardon him, Clifford: Bradley’s a gentleman of
no social parts. But since he has mentioned the
point—is there anything special you came for?”</p>

<p>“I came to talk,” said Clifford.</p>

<p>“Talk—good! Talking’s my trade!” Loveman
drew up a chair, so that the three of them formed a
square, the table of bottles filling the fourth side.
“Let ’er go—guest has the opening speech.”</p>

<p>“I suppose, Clifford, that this is where you’d like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
to have me make a quick exit,” said Bradley—and
he crossed his legs, folded his arms, bit upon his invariable
big cigar, and gave Clifford a challenging look.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, Bradley,” Clifford returned,
“I count it luck that I found you here, and I beg
you as a favor to remain. Bradley, Loveman,” he
said sharply, “I’ve come here for a show-down—to
tell you that I’m on to your little game!”</p>

<p>“Our game?” queried Loveman, with puzzled
blandness.</p>

<p>“Your game with Mary Regan and the Mortons.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” Loveman said softly. “Now, I wonder
if you’d mind giving a little information to an ignorant
man?”</p>

<p>Bradley’s face had suddenly become hard; his
little eyes were gleaming. But though Loveman’s
manner was blandly puzzled, Clifford knew the
little lawyer was as alertly watchful of him as
was Bradley—and was as much to be watched.</p>

<p>“I’ll put all my cards on the table, Loveman,” he
said with deliberation. “I’ll tell you exactly what
I know—which is also exactly what you know.
There’s nothing at all extraordinary about it; it’s
just the sort of thing that with a few variations
you’re doing over and over.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, am I really so monotonous!” protested
Loveman.</p>

<p>“You said you were going to put your cards on
the table,” cut in Bradley. “Come on, let’s see
your two-spots.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“We’ll go back a bit, Loveman,” said Clifford.
“Morton, senior, had entrusted you with the legal
end of some of his New York affairs; and when Jack
Morton came to New York, and began to get himself
tangled up through having too much money, the
father put it up to you to extricate his son. Good
profit in handling such affairs, Loveman: nice fee
for legal services rendered; a private split of the
sums for which the matters were settled; and an
unobtrusive arrangement whereby the son could be
drawn into further profitable predicaments. A big-paying
business, Loveman.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said the little lawyer pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Three or four months ago the father descended
upon New York in a fury. He declared he was
through settling for Jack’s troubles. He was going to
send Jack somewhere far away from New York—and
Jack had to take a brace, or the father would
drop him. Also there was a marriage with a rich
girl that the father wanted to put across—and
there’d be nothing doing unless Jack straightened
up. So Jack simply had to be braced up. Right
there, Loveman, was where you saw yourself losing
a big piece of your income. But you did some quick
thinking, and you fell in with the father’s idea that
Jack should be sent into retirement to reform. In
fact, you knew the very place, Pine Mountain Lodge.
And on your suggestion Jack was sent there.”</p>

<p>“And if I did mention Pine Mountain Lodge,
what of that?” Loveman mildly inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“You knew Mary Regan was there, and knew she
was the only attractive woman staying at the hotel.
And you knew that Jack Morton fell for about every
pretty woman that he met. Thrown together in that
isolation, you hadn’t a doubt of what he would do.
It was only a chance—but it was <i>your only chance</i>;
and if it worked out the way you thought it might,
there would be rich possibilities in the situation for
you—without your seeming to have been mixed
in the affair. Well, it worked out just as you
thought it might—and the possibilities lie ready
to your hand.”</p>

<p>“In case I’m overlooking anything good,” Loveman
remarked in the same gentle voice, “would you
mind telling me just what these possibilities are?”</p>

<p>“Of course the marriage had to be secret; otherwise
the possibilities would have been cut down by
two thirds. First item, after the marriage had taken
place, there was the possibility of getting hush money
out of Mary Regan by threatening to expose her.
You would never have appeared in this; Bradley
would have attended to this detail—perhaps
through one of his men. Second, after you had exhausted
the possibilities of blackmail, the next step
would have been to inform the father that you suspected
something was wrong with Jack. The father
would order the matter looked into; you would engage
Bradley for the job, and after a lengthy examination
Bradley would report a secret marriage—a big
bill for detective services. Third, you would then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
be retained to annul the marriage—and a big fee
there. Well, Loveman, Bradley,” he ended grimly,
“I believe that’s just about the outline of this particular
sweet little game!”</p>

<p>Bradley was glaring at him, his square jaws
clamped upon his cigar. Little Loveman, still with
his affable look, was twirling the tasseled end of his
girdle around a chubby forefinger.</p>

<p>“You’re very ingenious, very imaginative, Clifford.
But granting for the moment that you are
correct, what next?”</p>

<p>Clifford leaned sharply forward. “You are not
going through with it! I’m going to stop you!”</p>

<p>Clifford gazed tensely at the two men. A slight
quivering ran through Bradley’s frame; his cigar
fell, bitten through; his small, brilliant eyes were
points of vicious flame. Loveman still twirled the
end of his girdle, but now a bit more slowly. And
thus the three sat for several moments.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, without warning of word, seemingly
without any preliminary motion, Bradley’s
powerful body launched itself from a sitting posture
straight at Clifford. Clifford started to rise, and instinctively
threw up his arms; but to no avail, for
Bradley’s big hands broke past his weak defense and
gripped his throat. His chair went toppling over, the
table with its cargo of liquors went crashing to the
floor, and Clifford was carried resistlessly backward
by the force of Bradley’s lunge, until he came up
against the great library table. Over this he toppled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
his spine against the table’s edge, and Bradley drove
his head down upon the wood with a terrific thump.</p>

<p>“You’ll stop nothing!” grated Bradley. “You’ve
butted into my affairs for the last time!”</p>

<p>Clifford tried to struggle free, but he was caught
at too hopeless a disadvantage—his spine upon the
edge of the table, Bradley’s weight crushing upon
him, and that pair of hands clutching his throat. He
could move only his arms, and those to no purpose;
he could not cry out; he could not breathe. As his
chest heaved for lack of air, he read his doom in the
deadly fury of Bradley’s face. And he realized, even
could he call for help, the futility of such an outcry
in this apartment at the top of a lofty building, at
this heavily slumbrous hour of four.</p>

<p>He had been faintly conscious of hurried fumblings
about the desk—of the snap of a lock—of the
whine of a sliding drawer. Now, suddenly, as his
wide eyes were growing bleared, he saw a dark
something appear between his face and the face of
Bradley a bare two feet away. And then he saw
the something was a short, black pistol, and that the
pistol was flush against Bradley’s jaw, and that
the pistol was gripped in a soft, round hand that was
indubitably Loveman’s. And he heard Loveman’s
voice, no longer velvety, snap out:—</p>

<p>“Damn you, Bradley,—that rough stuff don’t
go with me! Let loose of him, or, by God, I’ll blow
your dam’ face off!”</p>

<p>Clifford saw Bradley’s flaming little eyes shift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
toward the speaker. Then he saw the monk-like
figure shift the pistol from jaw to Bradley’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll not kill you; I’ll splinter your dam’
bones,” the sharp voice cried with fierce decision.
“Get off that man before I count three, or your left
arm’ll be the first bone to go. One—two—”</p>

<p>The hands left Clifford’s throat, and the heavy
figure lifted itself from his body; and, thus freed,
Clifford slumped to the floor where he sat limply,
pantingly, against the table. Loveman had stepped
around the table, and Clifford now saw that he was
looking up at Bradley, and he saw that the cherubic,
large-eyed face of the lawyer was grim with an awful
wrath.</p>

<p>“You dam’ big boob!” cried the little man.
“You’d let yourself—and me!—in for a criminal
charge! And people have always said you have a
brain!”</p>

<p>“I’ve taken all I can from him!” Bradley said
thickly.</p>

<p>“Either you control your temper and cut out the
rough stuff,” snapped Loveman, “or you and I are
through!”</p>

<p>The pair gazed fixedly at each other. Neither
spoke. While they stood silent, Clifford became
aware of the Japanese butler, his back toward the
three of them and seemingly unaware of their doings,
on his knees picking up bottles and broken glass and
toweling up the spilled liquor from the rug.</p>

<p>Without replying, Bradley put his hands in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
trousers’ pockets, resumed his chair, and crossed
his legs. With an easy motion Loveman dropped the
pistol into a pocket of his dressing-gown, and stepped
to Clifford’s side. He was again the agreeable man-about-town
that Broadway liked so well.</p>

<p>“Too bad—but natural—the way men will lose
their tempers,” he said, as he helped Clifford to his
feet and into a chair. “How’re you feeling?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be all right in a breath or two.”</p>

<p>“Better let me give you a brandy?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Aw, it’s nothing!” cut in Bradley. “Let him
finish saying how he was going to stop us!”</p>

<p>“Do you feel like that—yet?” Loveman queried
solicitously.</p>

<p>Clifford was still dazed, but he was no less set in his
purpose. “Bradley’s right—a little scuffle like that
is nothing.”</p>

<p>“Good; a great thing to be in training!” Loveman
sank into his chair, smiling urbanely. “We’ve forgotten
what’s happened”; and he brushed the matter
into oblivion with a pleasant wave of the hand
that two minutes before had gripped the pistol. “As
I was about to remark—granting that you are
right, how are you going to stop it?”</p>

<p>“Of course I could stop it,” said Clifford, “by
telling Jack and Mr. Morton about Mary Regan
and her father and her uncle and her brother. At
any rate, that would smash your game.”</p>

<p>“As you say, provided, of course, there is a contemplated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
marriage, that would stop it,” Loveman
agreed pleasantly. “Why don’t you do that?”</p>

<p>“Considering the character of the Mortons and
the fact that she’s more worth while than they are,
telling on her seems to me a pretty raw deal to give
Mary Regan: to show her up to them, and give the
father, who’s as sympathetic as a shark, a chance to
take the lead, break it off, make a scandal out of it,
and to humiliate her in public.”</p>

<p>“That’s dam’ delicate of you, Clifford,” said Loveman,
“and I approve of your sentiments as a gentleman.
But if you don’t do that, how else are you
going to stop it?”</p>

<p>Clifford spoke calmly. “I’m going to stop it
through you.”</p>

<p>“Through me! Well, well! Do you mind telling
me, Clifford, just how I am going to do it?”</p>

<p>“You have some influence over Mary Regan; I
don’t pretend to know what it is. You go to her
to-morrow and you tell her, saying whatever is
necessary to bring her around, that she can’t go
through with the marriage. Then she breaks it off—and
not the Mortons, and they’ll not be any the
wiser about her.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, you certainly do seem to think I have
a very strong influence with the ladies,” Loveman
said blandly. “Very flattering, I assure you. But
supposing—all we’ve been talking about is mere
supposition, you know—supposing I have a mild
disinclination to do what you propose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Supposing that,” Clifford returned grimly, “then
I go to Mr. Morton, tell him about Mary Regan,
and tell him the whole thing was your plan. And
he’ll believe what I say about you, Loveman; I’ve
merely got to remind him that you suggested Pine
Mountain Lodge, prove to him that you knew Mary
Regan was there, prove to him that you’ve been
seeing Mary Regan in New York, and he’ll swallow
everything else. Result, the present scheme of you
and Bradley goes smash, and, further, you lose
all future business with your best-paying client.”</p>

<p>“Supposing, on the other hand,” Loveman remarked
in his same bland voice, “that I have no
disinclination to do what you suggest?”</p>

<p>“In that case, you only lose out on your present
plan. I’m not interested in Morton. You keep
his business. You see, Loveman, I’ve got you:
and what I’m offering is the best proposition for
you.”</p>

<p>Loveman gently stroked his crown. “Clifford, do
you believe in fairies?”</p>

<p>“Where does that come in?”</p>

<p>“You ought to believe in fairies, Clifford. You
really ought. With that imagination of yours,
you’d coin money, writing fairy-stories for children—simply
coin money.” He turned to Bradley.
“What do you say to Clifford’s proposition?”</p>

<p>“Tell him to go to hell!” said Bradley, his old
hatred flaring out.</p>

<p>“You’ll excuse Fido’s behavior, Clifford,” Loveman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
said apologetically. “He hasn’t had a biscuit
all day.”</p>

<p>“The real question is,” returned Clifford, “what
does Peter Loveman say to the proposition?”</p>

<p>“What do I say? Well, now, well,” Loveman said
pleasantly, “you know I never did believe in fairies
and so I can’t be expected to gulp down this remarkable
little story you’ve told me. But since you are
interested in Miss Regan, and are concerned that
nothing goes wrong with her—why, for your sake,
of course I’ll do it—I’ll do anything you say.”</p>

<p>Clifford stared penetratingly at the round face,
which never before looked more like the face of an
amiable monk. Behind that amiable face was a swift
thought that, after all, he might slip Nina Cordova
into this situation and that he’d square matters
with Nina the first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>“You’ll do it to-morrow?” demanded Clifford.</p>

<p>“To-morrow—sometime before noon.” And as
Clifford continued his keen glance: “You doubt
me? All right.” He walked to a section of his bookshelves
and came back with a large, dingy volume.
“Here’s a Bible—a Gutenberg, 1455. There can’t
be a holier Bible than this; just think, man, what
it cost. Go ahead—swear me.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll do it,” said Clifford. He rose. “I
believe that’s all, gentlemen. Good-night.”</p>

<p>As he started away Bradley glowered at him; but
Loveman, slipping an arm through his, escorted him
to the door. There Loveman held him for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“That was one grand fairy-tale, Clifford, you
dreamed about me,” he said with a smile through
which (perhaps purposely) there glinted ever so little
of mockery. “But supposing I do have any little
plan under way, I wonder how close you’ve come
to guessing it? Now, I wonder?”</p>

<p>Down in the quiet street, Clifford found himself
wondering too.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE TEST OF LIFE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> that he had won, now that the marriage and
Loveman’s plans were potentially blocked, there
should have been a let-down from Clifford’s long
strain. But there was not. The settling of this affair
seemed only to give mind-room to other concerns.
He tossed about restlessly during the few hours that
remained of the night; and he realized that his restlessness
was not due wholly to the suspense of waiting
for the finality that would come with Loveman’s
completed promise.</p>

<p>In the slow hours before the coming of the slate-colored
dawn a vague, disturbing doubt crept in
upon him. He had interfered with events, he had
tried to shape life upon his ideas: was his course
right?—that seemed to be something of the impalpable
substance of his doubt. But what this new
doubt was, strive as he would he could not evoke
it from its vagueness into definite shape.</p>

<p>He had breakfast; and then, obeying an impulse
which seemed to emerge from this new, obscure maze
of his mind, he suddenly decided to see Mary Regan
again—for what purpose he had no idea. Arrived
at the Grantham he had his name ’phoned up to
“Mrs. Gardner,” and was informed that Mrs. Gardner
would see him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>Mary herself admitted him, and, not even replying
to his “good-morning,” she led him into the
sitting-room. There she faced him, proud and coldly
defiant.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have come to inform me you have
told the Mortons all about me?”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Then, to threaten me again that you will tell?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then, what have you come for?”</p>

<p>He knew now—at least partly. During the moment
he had been in the room and had gazed upon
her, there had emerged from the maze of his thoughts
and feelings, a sharply defined repugnance to what
within the next hour or two was to happen between
her and Loveman: a repugnance, felt in her behalf,
that she should be made to yield to whatever influences
that cunning little lawyer would be able
to exert.</p>

<p>“I have come to ask you,” he said, trying to speak
composedly, but with all his being vibrant beneath
that composure, “to break off this affair with Jack
Morton of your own free will. You know you
don’t care for him. You know what you are planning
to do isn’t square. Why don’t you be true to the best
self that is in you and end it all yourself?—and
end it now? There’s the telephone,” he urged—remembering
that Loveman might any moment appear—“call
Jack Morton up and tell him you’ve
decided not to do it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>As he spoke, her face had grown sharp with decision.
“Mr. Clifford,” she exclaimed in a low, cutting
voice, “I’m tired of your presumption, your
interference! I’m tired of your trying to make me
be what you think I ought to be! As if it mattered
to me what you thought!”</p>

<p>She took a step nearer, her straight, young figure
stiffened, and her dark eyes flashed at him. “Understand
this, Mr. Clifford,—I’ve made up my mind,
and made it up definitely, finally. I am going to do
exactly what I want to do, and it is not in your
power to stop me or divert me. You may tell either
of the Mortons if you like—my real course will not
be changed—that will merely mean that I’ll do
what I want to do in some other way!”</p>

<p>Clifford did not attempt to answer. Her defiant
words, her young figure so rigid with its determined
spirit of worldliness, had set some strange force
working in him; a vague power seemed to be at conflict
with the purpose he had held to for so long; a
strange revulsion seized him, a revolution was under
way which was compelling in its sweeping drive, but
whose intent and direction for a moment he could
not perceive.</p>

<p>He stood still, and stared at her. And then out of
the inner turmoil came a clear, bright order; and then
he realized that the restlessness, the formless doubts
of the night before, had been the first faint stirrings
of this which was grown and clarified into a new purpose
and a new vision—a purpose and vision that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
astonished him. For they had come at the very time
when his old purpose was the same as achieved.</p>

<p>She could but notice the remarkable change in his
appearance. “Well, what is it now?” she demanded.</p>

<p>He drew a deep, quivering breath. A recklessness,
a defiance—but behind which his new purpose remained
cool—now possessed him. He was aware
that he had to act quickly, for any instant Peter
Loveman might be here.</p>

<p>“What is it now?” he repeated, with a provoking
smile. If he did not have power to stir her to love,
he knew that he had the power to stir her to anger.
“I was just recalling what you said a moment ago:
to the effect that you were going to do what you
pleased and do it when you pleased. Pardon me for
smiling—but when a woman boasts, it sometimes
is amusing and a bit absurd.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she said sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m smiling at myself, too, for I’ve just
realized what a fool I’ve made of myself in trying to
stop you—an entirely unnecessary effort. What I
mean, Miss Regan, is that I do not believe you could
do it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose you’d go through with your part
of it. But if put to the test of marrying at once, Jack
Morton would never go through with his part. He
may be a bit infatuated; but he’s too wise to marry
a woman without money—without knowing more
about who she is—and without his father’s approval.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
No wonder Jack has been putting this
off!”</p>

<p>She flushed hotly. “I have been the one to put it
off!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” he exclaimed with unbelief none too
polite. “From the way he was dancing last night
with Miss Cordova—you know, that pretty musical-comedy
star—I have an idea she’s had a lot
to do with the delay. And I imagine she’ll have a lot
more to do with further delay. Why, you poor
thing,”—he smiled irritatingly,—“to think you
could hold a man like Jack Morton—you having
to remain inactive, under cover—he free to roam
about with all sorts of charming women—particularly
with Miss Cordova!”</p>

<p>She did not speak for a moment. She was choked
with that anger on which he had so carefully counted:
no person, he knew, would be so likely to act upon
impulse as a proud and angered woman, before the
man who has insulted her.</p>

<p>“So you think I can’t do it!” she exclaimed. “So
he’s the one who is holding back! Well, I’ll just
show you! Anyhow, this thing might as well come
to a head right now. And I’ll give you your chance
to tell all you know about me.”</p>

<p>She turned and took up the telephone from the
writing-desk and asked for the Biltmore. Fortune
favored her purpose, for in a minute she had Jack
Morton on the wire.</p>

<p>“Can you come right over, Jack,—with your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
car?... No, don’t bring your chauffeur; drive yourself....
Why? I’ll tell you that when you come—only
bring plenty of wraps.... All right, I’ll be
ready; come right up.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be over in fifteen minutes,” she said to
Clifford. “You may wait if you like. But you’ll
excuse me.”</p>

<p>She passed into her bedroom. Clifford sank rather
limply into a chair. He had come to what just then
seemed the supreme crisis of his life, and he was still
dazed at the way he had willed that crisis to eventuate.
He sat thinking—thinking; the minutes she
was out were long minutes to him.</p>

<p>Presently she reëntered. She had changed to a
black velvet suit trimmed with black fur; a small
fur hat sat snugly down upon her thick, dark hair;
and she carried a fur motor-coat. She was an unforgettable
picture for him: the high color of her
dark face against the background of soft and sheeny
blacks.</p>

<p>She did not address Clifford; but there was little
time for their silence to become awkward, for almost
at once the bell of the suite rang. Mary went to the
door, and admitted Jack Morton. The pleasant-faced
young fellow looked most comfortably handsome
in his great motoring-coat of raccoon.</p>

<p>“I say, Mary, this is certainly fine!” he cried,
after he had kissed her. “And, hello—there’s Bob
Clifford. How’s the old boy?” He shook Clifford’s
hand warmly. “But say, Mary, what’s doing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Mary looked at Morton when she replied, but her
voice was directed at Clifford: “I’ve decided, Jack,
to give in to you. I’m ready to be married at once—to-day.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried young Morton, seizing both her
hands. “But we’ll have to keep it quiet—same as
we planned. You’re ready now?”</p>

<p>She did not answer. Clifford noted that her body
tautened and her breath was held—as one who
waits for a blow; and he understood that she was
waiting for, and expecting him to speak the truth
about her.</p>

<p>She slowly turned and looked at Clifford. Surprise
that he had said nothing was in her face. Then she
turned back to Morton.</p>

<p>“I’m all ready,” she said distinctly, so that Clifford
might not miss a word. “We’ll do as you suggested:
motor away back into the country to some
small place—get married—and a little money
spent judiciously there will keep our marriage quiet
as long as we like.” She turned again to Clifford.
“I’m sure we have the best wishes of Mr. Clifford.”</p>

<p>He knew that her words, and her straight look,
were not now so much challenge or defiance as
the bold offering him a second time the chance to
speak, and to speak at the most effective moment
imaginable. She might be perverse—but of a
certainty she had nerve!</p>

<p>“You surely have my wishes that it will all turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
out for the very best,” said Clifford; and again he
saw surprise in her gaze.</p>

<p>He rode down the elevator with them and walked
out to the curb where stood Morton’s machine, a
black, closed car with a long hood that bespoke the
engine-power of a racer. Morton was swinging open
the door when Clifford, trying to keep down the
choke that sought to rise in his throat, remarked
with attempted good-fellowship:—</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, Morton, I wish you’d wire
me as soon as it’s over. Here at the Grantham.”</p>

<p>“Sure, old man. Step in, Mary.”</p>

<p>Mary started to obey, then checked herself. “May
I speak to you a moment, Mr. Clifford?”</p>

<p>They moved a few paces away. She looked at him
penetratingly.</p>

<p>“Why have you done this?” she abruptly whispered.</p>

<p>“Done what?” he parried.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think that I see now that you have
forced my hand? That I am down here now, about
to do this, because you wanted me to do it? Why
are you doing it—when you could stop everything,
this moment, with just a few words?”</p>

<p>He gave her back a straight look and spoke deliberately.
“I have tried for a long time to do with
you what I saw as best—to pull the strings—and
I have failed, over and over. When you declared a
little while ago that I or nothing else could change
your purpose, I suddenly had a new vision. I realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
that if you were poor material I could not save you,
and that you would not be worth saving. And I
realized that if you were good material, only some
way that I had not tried could affect you; and it
came to me,” he went on grimly, “that bitter experience
might do for you what I had not done. And it
also came to me that if anything could arouse you
to the human realities, no experiences might be so
effective as what might lie before you in this very
marriage you had planned.”</p>

<p>“And that is why you said nothing?” she breathed.</p>

<p>He nodded. “I have taken my hands off, to give
life its chance to pull the strings.”</p>

<p>She gazed at him a moment longer. Then she
returned to the car. But as she stepped in, she
paused and glanced back once more. Her face was
very pale and dazed—it held the look of one who
wondered, but could not understand.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Restlessly, but with a heavy heart within him,
Clifford wandered about the great lobby of the
Grantham. A slow hour passed—then another.
Then he saw Peter Loveman, on his plump face an
expression which for Loveman was very serious,
come up the broad stairway and go straight for the
desk at which visitors sent up their names to guests
of the house. Loveman spoke to the blonde within
the grilled enclosure—waited—then walked away
with a sober, puzzled look. He sighted Clifford in
a deep lounging-chair, and his face on the instant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
grown genial, he crossed and dropped into a chair
beside him.</p>

<p>“Needn’t explain, Clifford,” he said pleasantly,
offering a cigarette from a lacquered case which Clifford
refused. “Sure, I understand what you showed
up here for: to see if I went through with what I
promised. Well, I just asked for her, and was told
she’d gone out. I’m going to wait for her—and I
suppose you’ll wait too.”</p>

<p>Clifford nodded.</p>

<p>Loveman tried to draw Clifford into conversation,
but his light remarks failing to evoke a response, he
looked through first the “Wall Street Journal,” and
then the “Morning Telegraph,” that organ of the
theater and the other diversions close to Broadway’s
life. Thus the two sat for over an hour, neither
speaking; then a page came by, calling in the impersonal
voice of hotel pages, “Telegram Mr. Clifford—Telegram
Mr. Clifford.”</p>

<p>Clifford took the yellow missive with a hand that
he tried to keep from shaking. He was quite certain
what was in it—the end of things, just as he had
suddenly planned them in his new vision of some
three or four hours earlier. Yet, none the less, he
had a moment of supreme and sickening suspense
as he opened the envelope.</p>

<p>Yes, it was just what he had expected. He gazed
fixedly at the typewritten lines before him—lines
which were like heavy doors swinging to and locked
between him and that of which he had dreamed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Then he became conscious that the big round eyes of
little Peter Loveman were gazing at him curiously.
Silently he handed the telegram to the lawyer.</p>

<p>Loveman glanced the telegram through. “The
devil!” he cried. Then he read it again, this time
aloud:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Married quiet place ten miles from here. Everybody
will keep it secret. Happy you bet.</div>

<div class="verseright">J.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Loveman stared at Clifford. “And it’s addressed
to you!” he exclaimed. “Say, this means you’ve
crossed yourself! What the devil are you up to?”</p>

<p>Clifford did not answer.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, then Loveman
whispered to himself: “And I just promised Nina
Cordova!”</p>

<p>Again Clifford did not answer; he did not hear
Loveman. Such of his senses as were not numbed
by the finality of which that telegram was the token
were directed into that unfinal future which human
vision could not penetrate. How was it all going to
work out for Mary Regan? Was experience going to
do for her what he had failed to do, or was experience
going to stimulate to complete and final dominance
her worldliness? And had he played into Peter
Loveman’s hands? And what would Loveman do?</p>

<p>But these were questions only Life could answer.
He had stepped aside to give Life full play, to let
human impulses move unhindered by him toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
their destiny; and he must wait until Life was ready
to speak.</p>

<p>He was subconsciously aware that Loveman’s
round eyes were fixed upon him sharply, and he was
subconsciously aware that the keen brain behind
that round face was working swiftly, ranging in every
direction. But without looking at Loveman again, or
speaking to him, he rose heavily and went down the
broad marble stairway, muted with rugs, out into
the winter twilight. These questions that engaged
his mind were none of his affair. Mary Regan, as far
as she touched his personal life, was now become
an episode that was closed. He had other affairs to
fill his life; he must turn himself to them.</p>

<p>And yet, as he walked away ... he wondered....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE GOLDEN DOORS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hour was eleven-thirty of that same night.
Clifford sat in the Gold Room at the Grantham, and
kept a careful eye upon the proceedings across the
great room at the little corner table known among
the waiters as “Mr. Loveman’s table.”</p>

<p>Clifford watched many persons speak briefly to
Loveman. He tried to guess what the shrewd little
lawyer might now be up to. Among those who
came to Loveman’s table he particularly noted a
dark, perfectly tailored young man, of perhaps
thirty, with the lithe slenderness of the expert
dancing male. Clifford knew him by name and
reputation, and already he had set him down as one
he must watch, together with Loveman and Bradley.</p>

<p>But for all his efforts to concentrate upon his
present business, Clifford’s mind kept shifting back
to Mary Regan. It was a most difficult situation
which she had taken upon herself: the daughter
of one famous criminal, the niece of another, the
sister of another, and herself a former participant
in criminal acts—secretly married to a rich young
man who knew nothing of her past, and who was
dependent upon the approval of an autocratic father.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
To succeed in the soaring worldly plans she
had admitted to him with such cold frankness would
require marvelous skill, marvelous daring, marvelous
self-control. Well—skill, daring, control, she
had them!</p>

<p>But there was Loveman to be considered. Clifford
asked himself if he had deduced aright Loveman’s
plans concerning her? Loveman’s words,
spoken in the early hours of that morning, and
spoken with mockery glinting through his habitual
amiability of manner, came back to him: “Just
supposing I do have any little plan under way, Clifford,
I wonder how close you’ve come to guessing
it? Now, I wonder?”</p>

<p>Looking over at the cherubic face of the shrewd
little lawyer, Clifford felt for the moment all the
doubt that these words had been intended to arouse.
Had he, perhaps, guessed only a part of Loveman’s
plan?—or was he altogether wrong?</p>

<p>And Clifford’s restless mind flashed to his last act
in the destiny of Mary Regan: the extreme measure
he had resorted to in taunting her into that
impulsive marriage with Jack Morton; and then
his telling her with almost brutal directness, during
the brief moment just before she and Jack
had motored off, that he had come to realize that
only going her own worldly way, only the experience
of life, could avail to awaken the real woman
that was in her.</p>

<p>He wondered. But only time, as it unrolled its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
film of unborn events, could answer these questions.
He could now do no more than hope the best results
for Mary Regan—wherever she might be.</p>

<p>With an effort Clifford brought himself back to
his present business, and again gave sharp attention
to that darkly handsome figure of the dancing
man. And then—his heart skipped a beat or two.
Across the line of his vision, coming from the main
entrance of the Gold Room, and convoyed by a
suave captain of waiters, walked Mary Regan and
Jack Morton. They were ushered to a side table,
and at once fell into intimate talk.</p>

<p>Clifford, after his first surprise, watched them
closely; and he quickly perceived that, though she
smiled and chatted, not more than the surface of
Mary’s attention was given to her husband of a
dozen hours. He tried to look beneath, to what was
going on in the hidden deeps of her mind....</p>

<p>That mind was teeming. For her this was a moment
of triumph, of exultation. As she had told
Clifford, with her cool directness, she had analyzed
herself, and had decided that she was a worldling,
and, moreover, she knew herself a competent worldling.
The things in life that to her were worth while
were luxury, admiration, the pleasures that money
could buy. She had dreamed this dream—and
here was her dream come true!</p>

<p>Her quickened eyes, with a new sense, swiftly
took in this great room, decorated in gold and black
and with hangings of a kingly blue brocade, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
with smartly dressed people at the tables or swinging
in alluring rhythm in the latest dances. After
the studied maneuvers, and sometimes necessary
seclusion of life with her uncle, all this gayety, and
richness, and freedom, warmed the heart of her desire.
All this was now hers!—hers whenever she
wished it!</p>

<p>It was as if golden doors had swung open. From
her subconscious mind these two magic words had
emerged to the very forefront of her thought, had
become a mental figure of speech which she concretely
visualized as a glorious structure which almost
existed—Golden Doors!...</p>

<p>Clifford, watching that rapt face, hardly noted
that Jack had sighted him and was bearing down
upon him until Jack seized him by the shoulder and
dragged him over to where Mary sat.</p>

<p>“Look who’s here, Mary,—almost my bridesmaid!”
Jack cried gayly. “Sit down, Clifford,”
pressing Clifford into a chair and reseating himself.
“Now, come across with congratulations!”</p>

<p>Clifford tried to restrain all personal feeling from
his tone, and to speak lightly. “I can’t do better
than to say what’s always said—that I hope marriage
is going to make a real man out of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you do! And I suppose”—with joyous
acerbity—“that that’s what you’re wishing for
Mary—that it’ll make a real woman out of her!”</p>

<p>Clifford still tried to speak easily. “Honestly,
now, could one make a better wish for a woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
than that she should never be anybody else but her
best self?”</p>

<p>Mary met his gaze steadily. On his side he tried
to look, and feel, the part of one who is no more than
a casual friend—but, despite his effort at this detached
rôle, he could not help guessing at just what
was going on behind that calm face.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a thought on your chest,” remarked
Jack. “Better cough it up.”</p>

<p>“I am merely feeling a bit surprised at seeing you
back again.”</p>

<p>“Surprised? Why?”</p>

<p>“I imagined you’d stay away for a while.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough of the St. Helena life—and so
has Mary. New York’s the only place!”</p>

<p>“Where are you going to live?”</p>

<p>“Right here at the Grantham. That is, till we
like something better.”</p>

<p>“Then you are registered here?” pursued Clifford.</p>

<p>“Not I. Mary is, since she’s been living here. I
was just going to have my things sent over from the
Biltmore, and then register with the special hotel
pen, which has two ink drops that flow as one.”</p>

<p>Clifford was silent for a moment. He had noted
that Peter Loveman was watching them from his
corner, and that the lithe, dark gentleman he had
been closely observing during the evening—his
name was Hilton—was now seated at the table
adjoining them and was covertly watching Mary.</p>

<p>“Don’t register here together,” he said abruptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Why not?” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>“Would you mind explaining?” Mary asked
quietly.</p>

<p>Clifford remembered himself. Only that very
morning he had told Mary that he would no longer
try to help shape the course of her life—that he
would keep his hands off—that hereafter he would
let Life pull the strings of her destiny. And here he
was interfering again.</p>

<p>“I guess I wasn’t thinking,” he said, trying to
be casual. “Anyhow, it’s really none of my business.”</p>

<p>Mary gazed at him sharply. She surmised that
some idea had been behind his remark; but she did
not speak. Jack, whose gaze had wandered, gave
a start and cried out:—</p>

<p>“Hello, there’s dad! And he’s spotted us—look,
he’s coming this way!”</p>

<p>Clifford glanced at Jack’s father, an erect man of
fifty, with unchallengeable dominance in his manner
which the lordship of large affairs had developed
from his native self-confidence. Then quickly Clifford
glanced back, and managed to comprehend with
his gaze both Mary and the dark man at the next
table. Mary, grown tense as crisis approached in
the form of the elder Morton, said quickly to Jack
in a low voice:—</p>

<p>“Introduce me by another name: Gilmore—anything!”</p>

<p>At the same moment Clifford saw her hands beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the table swiftly remove engagement and
wedding rings and thrust them into a white glove
which lay in her lap. Also he noted that the dark
gentleman had caught this action; and he noted that
the black eyes glinted with a sudden light.</p>

<p>The next moment he heard Mary being introduced
as Miss Gilmore. Clifford watched the meeting
keenly.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to meet Miss Gilmore,” the elder
Morton said, bowing over her hand and taking her
in with a swift, appraising eye. He had a reputation
of a sort as a connoisseur of femininity, and
what he saw was evidently pleasing to him.</p>

<p>“And I am glad to meet you,” Mary returned.</p>

<p>Clifford knew her self-control, but he was freshly
amazed at the composed agreeability with which
she met her unsuspecting father-in-law.</p>

<p>“Of course, you know Mr. Clifford,” Jack went
on nervously. “Sit down, dad. We were just finishing
a little supper. Can’t I order something for
you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing for me, son. But I’ll sit with Miss
Gilmore and you for a minute.”</p>

<p>He took a chair, and fixed his gray eyes, trained
to penetrate and read what others would hide from
him, upon Mary. Clifford tautened with suspense
as these two sat face to face. And out of the tail
of his eye he saw that the dark man was covertly
watching and listening.</p>

<p>“I don’t get to New York very often, Miss Gilmore,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Mr. Morton continued, “but this time I’m
making it an old man’s business and pleasure to try
to recapture some of my own youth by getting acquainted
with Jack’s friends. I suppose he’s known
you a long time?”</p>

<p>“On the other hand, we first met quite recently.”</p>

<p>“If I knew how to be gallant in your Eastern
fashion, I might remark that Jack has lost a lot,
then. I wonder if you’re one of our leading actresses?
Jack seems to know so many stage people.”</p>

<p>“I’m not even the greatest motion-picture star
yet discovered; and you know there are thousands
of her. I’m just an ordinary woman.”</p>

<p>“Not ordinary!” protested Mr. Morton. “I suppose— But,
of course, this curiosity of a provincial
must be offensive to you?”</p>

<p>“I did not know that a Chicagoan ever admitted
himself a provincial.”</p>

<p>“Call it the prying curiosity of an old father.
That’s just as bad.”</p>

<p>“A father should be curious,” Mary said evenly.</p>

<p>“I was about to say that I suppose you are a
native New Yorker?”</p>

<p>“Not in the sense that you probably mean—that
I am of an old family here, and have a lot of relations.”</p>

<p>“But you are a New Yorker?”</p>

<p>“I was born here. But a large part of my life
I spent in France—where,” she added, “both my
parents died.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“An orphan—and no relations! Perhaps you
are one of those independent New York bachelor
girls we read about?”</p>

<p>“I live with an aunt. We have an apartment—just
a little box of a thing.”</p>

<p>“Indeed. Would it be presuming too much on
Jack’s friendship if I might call upon you and your
aunt?”</p>

<p>“Aunt Isabel and I will be pleased to have you,”
she returned evenly.</p>

<p>“Thank you. If you will find out just when it
will be most convenient for her, and let me know
through Jack, I’ll be there.”</p>

<p>Clifford had to admire the composure with which
she carried herself through this polite but dangerous
inquisition—every instant of which, he saw,
was an almost unbearable strain upon the suspense-ridden
Jack. But by her invention of an aunt,
which had opened the way for a proposal to call, he
felt that she might have made a fatal slip. But
there was no telling: it looked bad, yes,—but she
had a faculty, a gift, for smoothly extricating herself
from the worst of situations.</p>

<p>Before this cross-examination could proceed further,
little Peter Loveman appeared at the table.
Clifford instantly surmised the shrewd little lawyer’s
motive: he had witnessed the scene, and, knowing its
dangers to himself, sought to intervene before there
could be exposure and explosion.</p>

<p>“Pardon me for breaking in on your party, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Morton,” he said, with his glib amiability. “But
some facts just came to my knowledge which, as
your lawyer, I feel you ought to know at once.”</p>

<p>“All right; I was just leaving, anyhow. Jack,
I’ve been wanting to see you all day—it’s really
very important. I wonder if Miss Gilmore would
forgive you, and us, if we left her with Mr. Clifford?”</p>

<p>It had been a scene that had almost crumpled
Jack. Mary saved the situation for him by speaking
promptly but with composure.</p>

<p>“It will be quite all right, Mr. Morton.”</p>

<p>“To pay the check with,” Jack mumbled huskily,
pushing a bank-note beside Clifford’s plate.</p>

<p>The next moment Clifford and Mary were alone.
She gazed across at him very steadily, not speaking.
Her breath came with a slight, fluttering irregularity,
and her face had taken on a slight pallor; he
could guess how much the stress of the last few
minutes had taxed her. She glanced about the tables
for a brief space, then her eyes came back to him.</p>

<p>“I’d like to go up to my apartment,” she said
quietly.</p>

<p>Clifford paid the bill and escorted her out of the
great, glittering room. Near the row of elevators
she halted and faced him.</p>

<p>“What was in your mind a while ago when you
started to tell Jack and me not to register here
together?”</p>

<p>He tried to speak coldly. “Please overlook that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
I forgot for the moment that I had promised you
I would not again interfere in your affairs.”</p>

<p>“Please tell me what was in your mind,” she
quietly insisted.</p>

<p>“First of all, I was surprised that you and Jack
should return to New York—so soon.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Something similar to what has just happened
was bound to happen if you appeared in New York
openly together—only it might have been a great
deal worse. And that worse thing would inevitably
have happened if you two had registered. I thought
you would have considered this danger.”</p>

<p>“I had thought of it, yes,—that is, before to-day.
But to-day so much was happening to me—it was
all so sudden—that all day I was thinking of other
things.”</p>

<p>He looked at her sharply, a sudden leaping at his
heart. Was he in any way concerned in those other
things? But he put the question from him.</p>

<p>Abruptly he obeyed an impulse that had been
growing in him. “May I break my promise to the
extent of telling you of a few matters?”</p>

<p>“Please do.”</p>

<p>“You have chosen your own way,” he said, in
even tones, looking very straight into her dark
eyes, “but—well, after all, I want you to make the
best of it for yourself. These few facts—perhaps
you know them already—may help you. First, and
I say this without any personal prejudice to Jack,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Jack has the reputation of caring for many women
often rather than for one woman long. Second,
largely for business reasons, Mr. Morton desires to
have Jack marry a girl from Chicago. Third, this
girl’s parents will not consider such a marriage
until Jack has proved that he has settled down;
therefore, it naturally is Mr. Morton’s dominating
desire at present that Jack should become a steady
business man. He’d like to have Jack enter the
New York offices of his firm. That is all. If you
think these matters over, perhaps you will see a
way in which they may serve you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shall. Thank you.” She moved to
the elevators, and stood silent until a car opened.
“Good-night,” she said, and stepped inside.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” he returned.</p>

<p>He stood an instant after her car had shot upward.
She had chosen her own course. And this
was only the beginning of the consequences. What
might the ending be?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>MARY PLANS ANEW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following morning Clifford called at the Grantham
and asked if Mrs. Morton was in.</p>

<p>The clerk examined the hotel’s file of guests.
“There is no Mrs. Morton staying here.”</p>

<p>So, after all, they had not registered. He recalled
that Mary had formerly been known here as Mrs.
Gardner.</p>

<p>“May I see Mrs. Gardner, then?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Gardner moved from the Grantham early
this morning,” replied the clerk. “I’d just come on
duty when she left.”</p>

<p>“Was there a—was her brother with her?”</p>

<p>“She was alone.”</p>

<p>“If you will kindly give me her new address—”</p>

<p>“She left no address.”</p>

<p>Clifford walked out of the Grantham in deep
thought. Mary had realized her situation, she had
acted promptly. But what was her plan?—for undoubtedly
she had evolved a plan during the night.
And where had she gone?</p>

<p>And how was it all going to work out? To be
sure, the penetration of the designs of Loveman
and Bradley was his real business; but he could
not help himself, he was vastly more interested in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
what Mary might be doing, and in what was to be
the end of it all for her. He called on Slant-Face;
but her brother still had not seen or heard from
her directly since her return to New York. He kept
Loveman under surveillance, and also Bradley; the
maneuvers of either might lead him to her. And
also he kept watch upon Hilton, whose eyes had
suddenly lighted when he had seen Mary quickly
thrust her rings into her gloves. But he picked up
nothing.</p>

<p>Clifford might have been greatly helped in his
search for Mary by Commissioner Thorne: a general
alarm might quickly have located her. But he
did not want Mary brought before the general attention
of the police. However questionable the
ethics of the course her ambition had planned, there
was in it nothing that was legally criminal.</p>

<p>For a week he kept close surveillance upon Loveman,
Bradley, and the dark young man; and learned
not a thing about Mary and not a thing about the
plans of the others. Then one day he ran across the
elder Morton, who had just returned to the city
after a trip to Chicago.</p>

<p>“You won’t believe it when I tell you,” said the
older man, “but Jack’s gone to work.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“In my New York offices. Been working there
a week—and they tell me he’s been as regular as
a clock. Remarkable change!” His voice lowered.
“But here’s a point that seems odd: though he’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
kept his rooms at the Biltmore, the people there
have hardly seen him.”</p>

<p>The finding of Mary now seemed simple enough.
But Clifford realized that mere knowledge of her
whereabouts would not satisfy him. Clifford considered
rapidly how he might achieve a private
meeting with her. Half an hour later he was sitting
with Uncle George in Monsieur Le Bain’s
Grand Alcazar, and was telling this wise old man
of Broadway all that had happened.</p>

<p>“Certainly some little situation for Mary Regan!”
Uncle George looked at Clifford with his shrewd
old lashless eyes. “But, son, I hope your motor’s
not missing fire over her—and her a married
woman?”</p>

<p>“I’m concerned because I’m certain Loveman is
planning to use her. I can protect her better, and
I stand a better chance to land Loveman, if I know
where she is.”</p>

<p>“H’m. And is that the three-mile limit of your
interest?”</p>

<p>“I’m human enough to want to know what she’s
done and how she’s planned to meet the future.
Knowing that will help me against Loveman.”</p>

<p>“Well, son, be sure you’re not passing phony
money off on yourself—which is what the average
citizen does when he thinks he has one of these here
righteous thoughts. I suppose you’ve got me fitted
into some nice little idea?”</p>

<p>“You’re going to help me meet her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“Oh, that’s all, is it!” the old man said dryly.
“All I’ve got to do is to step out on Broadway,
touch her on the sleeve, and say, ‘Good-afternoon,
Mary; Bob Clifford wants to one-step with you to
a bit of nice chin-music’—and in she’ll come wearing
a smile on all four sides, you being so popular
with her!”</p>

<p>“All you’ve got to do, Uncle George, is something
else. Jack likes you; Mary considers you one
of her best friends. You go into that telephone
booth, call up Jack at his father’s office, and learn
where she is—and after you’ve learned that we’ll
dope out the rest.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think that in my old age I’d sink to be
a stool for a copper,” sighed Uncle George, with
mock mournfulness.</p>

<p>He heaved his big body up and crossed to a booth.
Five minutes later he swayed back to Clifford’s
side.</p>

<p>“I got a line on her. But it’s up to me to do
some of this here super-delicate detective work. Sit
where you are—though it’s an awful risk to leave
you alone and unprotected right over a wine cellar.
I may be back in an hour. So-long.”</p>

<p>He was back in half an hour. “She’s having tea
over at the Ritz. Come on. I got a taxi waiting
outside.”</p>

<p>He led the way out and across the sidewalk, bulking
large before Clifford. “May God pity an old
sinner for what’ll be comin’ to him for this!” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
murmured. At the door of the taxi he stepped
aside. “Get in first,” he said to Clifford; and, as
Clifford obeyed, he smartly closed the door on Clifford’s
back. “All right,” he called to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>As the taxi moved away, a startled voice within
the car exclaimed: “You!”</p>

<p>Clifford then saw that he was sitting beside Mary.
“Miss Regan!” he ejaculated, forgetting her new
name.</p>

<p>“Uncle George told me we were to pick up
Jack.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll forgive the deception. Don’t blame
Uncle George. Blame me.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I felt I had to see you at once.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You see, I could hardly help wanting to know
what you had done.”</p>

<p>He had thought it more than likely that she would
be angry. Her dark eyes did flash at him; but when
she spoke she spoke very calmly.</p>

<p>“There’s no reason why you should not know;
and I have no objections to telling you everything.
What do you wish to know first?”</p>

<p>“What you did first.”</p>

<p>She considered, then spoke with a cold frankness
that was in keeping with her recent attitude toward
him—to show him her calculating worldliness,
stark, unexcused.</p>

<p>“I thought I had passed through the Golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Doors,—that’s a phrase of mine,—but after that
night at the Grantham when I saw you, I realized
that I still stood far without them. I saw that I
had either to vanish—or be willing to wait my
time, perhaps a long time, if I would see it through.
I decided on the latter.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Clifford prompted.</p>

<p>“That meant,” the unsparing voice went on,
“that for a long time Jack and I would hardly dare
be seen openly together, that we had to live in seclusion.
I made Jack see things as I saw them, so we
sublet an apartment on Riverside Drive, and we’re
known there as Mr. and Mrs. Grayson.”</p>

<p>“And what about Jack’s going to work?”</p>

<p>“I thought that if through my influence Jack
should settle down, it would help when his father
finds out.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“I realize perfectly,” the cold voice continued,
“another problem that I have to face. Jack likes gay
company; further, you said it is not his nature to
care for one woman long. Well, I must make Jack
like me for a long time, and make him like me despite
the solitude. I shall do it.” She paused, then
added: “I believe that is everything.”</p>

<p>They rode on in silence, Clifford covertly eyeing
the erect, contained figure beside him—guessing at
what it must have cost her to give up her dreamed-of
pleasure, to be forced into seclusion, to be forced
to undertake the responsibility of sobering down a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
joyous spendthrift. Life certainly had not given her
what she had expected in her bargain.</p>

<p>Again the question rose: how was it all coming
out?</p>

<p>The next afternoon Clifford, following Hilton,
saw his quarry enter the Mordona, the great apartment
house on the Drive before which he had left
Mary the night before. He followed into the lobby
just as his man disappeared into an elevator. He had
no doubt on whom the dark gentleman was calling,
or for what reason he called.</p>

<p>Opening into the elaborate lobby, for whose
gilded ostentation the tenants were assessed a goodly
portion of their rent, was a florist’s shop. Into the
comparative privacy of this Clifford stepped to wait
until his man came down: a move that was just in
time, for from a descended elevator, which must
have passed the one bearing Hilton aloft, stepped
the square, solid figure of Bradley. Again Clifford
had no doubt on whom the call had been made, or
why.</p>

<p>At last he had picked up a warm and very busy
trail. Under pretense of an indecision over the flowers
he should purchase, he waited for his man to
come down, trying to reproduce the scene that was
now going on in the “Graysons’” apartment, and
the scene prior to it in which Bradley had figured. A
quarter of an hour passed, then the debonair Hilton
emerged from an elevator and strode out with a
jaunty, smiling air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>The next moment Clifford was in an elevator,
shooting upward, and two minutes later Mary’s
maid was bearing his card through a curtained doorway.
He caught Mary’s voice sounding as though
it were two rooms away, finishing what was obviously
a telephone conversation: “You’ll come as
soon as you can get here? That’s most kind of you.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>There was a delay; he guessed that Mary was surprised
at this third successive call; then he was shown
through the curtained doorway into the drawing-room.
His swift impression of the room was that it
was large for a New York apartment, and that its
prodigal furnishings bespoke wealth rather than taste
on the part of its absent lessee. The next moment
Mary came in through a door which he judged led
from the library. There was now in her bearing
nothing of the cold frankness which she had shown
him the day before. She was taut with controlled excitement,
which he knew to be the product of the
so recent interviews. Her manner was challenging.</p>

<p>“What do <i>you</i> want?”</p>

<p>He tried to speak in a steady, impersonal tone.
“Mr. Bradley was here a few minutes ago. I’d be
obliged if you’d tell me what he came for.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me for not obliging you—but that is
my own affair. Is this all?”</p>

<p>“Another gentleman just called on you. Would
you tell me what he wanted?”</p>

<p>“That also is my own affair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“It might help me greatly if I knew exactly what
he asked for,” Clifford urged.</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But that cannot concern me.”</p>

<p>“Then you will not tell?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Are you aware who this man is?”</p>

<p>“He’s a friend of Jack’s.”</p>

<p>“Not much of a friend, I hope.” Clifford still
spoke in his steady, impersonal tone. “Mr. Hilton is
one of several men that I am after—and he’s one
of the cleverest and most dangerous of the lot. It is
the easiest thing in the world for a crook who is well-dressed,
well-mannered, and who can dance, to make
acquaintances wherever he likes. The regular game
of these crooks is to pick out a woman with money,
or who can get money, make her acquaintance, gain
her confidence and some of her secrets, and then lead
her into a situation where she must pay or be exposed.
This is your last visitor’s special line. You
might help me a lot if you would tell me what Mr.
Hilton wanted from you.”</p>

<p>“He came to see me about a personal matter of
no importance,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Pardon me if I do not believe you,” he said.</p>

<p>She made no response.</p>

<p>“You will not tell?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to tell,” was her steady answer.</p>

<p>“I might force you to tell—” he snapped at her,
but instantly cut himself off.</p>

<p>“Since you won’t tell me,” he said, stepping more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
squarely before her, “then I’ll tell you. Bradley
came here to blackmail you; blackmail is one of Bradley’s
big side-lines just now. Hilton was a follow-up
man on the same business. If he wasn’t in this
particular game before, he got next the other night
at the Grantham. He saw you slip off your rings and
hide them when Jack’s father was coming to your
table. He guessed what that action meant, and it
was easy for him to dig up the rest.”</p>

<p>Clifford paused. “I’m right so far, yes?” he demanded.</p>

<p>But she did not speak.</p>

<p>“And I can tell you just what he said,” Clifford
continued, “and how he said it—for he’s a most
gentle-spoken party. It would cause him very great
regret to have to tell Mr. Morton that his son had
contracted a secret marriage, and it would cause
him even greater regret to have to tell both the Mortons
just who Mary Regan has been and just who
are the members of her family. The only way he can
be saved from inflicting upon himself this regret is
for you to come across with a large sum of money.
Well, isn’t that about it? Now will you help me
out?”</p>

<p>“I can say no more than I have said,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Then I shall have to get him alone,” Clifford
said, with grim quiet. “Him and the others.”</p>

<p>He left her with no further word. On the way
down in the elevator he recalled the fragment he
had heard over the telephone; and again he stepped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
into the convenient privacy of the florist’s shop.
Not more than two minutes had passed when he
saw Peter Loveman enter one of the elevators. So it
was Loveman she had been telephoning to. She had
doubtless sent for the little lawyer to ask his advice—the
irony of it!</p>

<p>Clifford waited for Loveman to descend. Fifteen
minutes passed—it was now getting on toward six;
then into the lobby, walking eagerly, came Jack
Morton. And then in the entrance, watching but
discreetly unobtrusive, appeared Jack’s father.
Jack’s elevator had made its trip up and had just
descended, when the elder Morton crossed the lobby
and addressed the elevator-man. The florist’s door
stood open, so Clifford heard every word.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Mr. Morton, “what is the
name of the gentleman, your only passenger, that you
just took up? I thought I recognized him as an acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Grayson, sir.”</p>

<p>“He lives here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he has one of your bachelor apartments?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. He lives here with Mrs. Grayson.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. I didn’t know Mrs. Grayson’s health
had permitted her to come back from California.
Please don’t mention my having been here; they
might feel hurt at my not having come up.”</p>

<p>He slipped the man a bill and went out. Clifford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
realized that Mr. Morton had been engaged upon a
bit of private sleuthing on his own account: which
might lead to—what?</p>

<p>Clifford thought a moment. Then he sought out
the superintendent of the building, and after some
very confidential talk, and a showing of credentials,
which the superintendent verified by calling up Police
Headquarters, he departed, bearing with him a
pass-key to all the apartments of the Mordona.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>A GENTLEMAN OF PLEASURE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were at least four persons that Clifford knew
it was desirable to keep under surveillance—Bradley,
Peter Loveman, Mr. Morton, and Hilton; but
the professional ladies’ man he regarded as the best
clue to the immediate situation. “Yes, you stick
to Hilton,” Uncle George agreed decisively that
evening at dinner. “When it comes to twisting
women, that dear limber guy is a better committee
on ways and means than any charmer that ever
adorned himself in a smile, pumps, and a dress
suit.”</p>

<p>That night Clifford trailed Hilton from restaurant
to theater, and then to three of the smartest hotel
ballrooms, and then, toward three in the morning,
saw him to his hotel. He picked Hilton up at noon
the next morning; lunched (it was Hilton’s breakfast)
at a table near him at the Ritz-Carlton; followed
him to a few restaurants where afternoon
dancing was under way; and at exactly half-past
five he followed him into the Mordona.</p>

<p>He gave Hilton a minute’s start, then rode up
to the “Graysons’” apartment. Hilton had evidently
been admitted, for the corridor was empty.
Muffling the lock with a handkerchief, Clifford slipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
in the pass-key, and swiftly, but with velvet caution,
he opened the door. Inside, he closed the door
with as great care, and stood, unbreathing, listening
kitchenward for the maid—fingers on lips and
a bill held out to check immediately any words
should that young lady appear: a needless stratagem,
since Mary had given her maid that afternoon out.
Hearing nothing, he moved softly to the curtained
doorway of the drawing-room, and glanced in. Apparently
Mary had planned to go out to an early
dinner, for she wore an evening gown. She was standing
erect in the middle of the room, gazing with level
eyes at the immaculate Mr. Hilton.</p>

<p>“I am here at five-thirty, as I said I’d be,” Hilton
was saying, smiling pleasantly. “I hope you
have seen the wisdom of my remarks and have reconsidered
your defiant attitude of yesterday. You
undoubtedly have a very good plan, and it would be
most unfortunate”—his voice was soothingly argumentative—“if
you compelled me to tell Mr.
Morton about the marriage, and tell them both
who your relatives are, and just who is Mary Regan.
Most unfortunate, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“You need not squander your emotion. I have
the money.”</p>

<p>“I approve your good sense! You have the full
amount?”</p>

<p>“You may count it for yourself.” She held out a
little roll.</p>

<p>“Ten five-hundred-dollar bills. Correct. Though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
it pinches me that you could not make it the ten thousand
I asked for. However! I suppose”—in high
good humor—“you’d like a receipt for this. It
might help you in court if you ever decided to bring
action against me.”</p>

<p>“Your jocularity is not greatly appreciated. Now
that you have the money, I suggest that you go.”</p>

<p>“As pleases you.” Drawing back the lapel of his
slender afternoon coat—it had been a warm afternoon,
and he had worn no outer coat—he slipped
the bank-notes into the top pocket of his vest. “In
leaving you, Mrs.—ah—Grayson, let me wish
your little enterprise the most complete success.
Good-afternoon.”</p>

<p>Clifford was on the point of springing into the
room, when, to his amazement, from the door which
opened into the library, there emerged the plump
figure of Peter Loveman. On the face of the shrewd
little lawyer was a bewildered, almost sickly look,
the like of which Clifford had never beheld on that
usually amiable and ruddy countenance.</p>

<p>“Just a minute!” said Loveman.</p>

<p>Hilton whirled about. “Oh, it’s Loveman!
Hello, Loveman.”</p>

<p>Loveman crossed toward the other. “What are
you doing here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Just making a little afternoon call. Will you return
the courtesy and tell me how you come to be
here?”</p>

<p>“I was here when you came, and was waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
until you had gone to finish my talk with Mrs.
Grayson.” Clifford could see that the control which
had slipped away from Loveman was regained, for
the little man was benign again—therefore, dangerous.
“Are you sure, Hilton,” he said softly,
“that your purpose here was only to call?”</p>

<p>“Merely social, Loveman,” the other replied,
smiling.</p>

<p>“I think, Hilton,” continued Loveman, in his
soft, pleasant tone, “that anything you got here
you’d better return to Mrs. Grayson.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to return.”</p>

<p>“I think you’ll find it wiser and more profitable
in the end to return it,” went on Loveman’s pleasant
voice.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to return,” repeated the other,
drawing on his gloves.</p>

<p>The two men gazed at each other steadily. Clifford
could see that beneath Hilton’s smiling politeness
there was defiance, that beneath Loveman’s
soft manner there was menace. He was puzzled by
this hostility, for he had figured that the pair, with
Bradley, were working together. But he instantly
perceived why this hostility should be masked; the
two spoke thus indirectly because neither, or at
least not Loveman, wished Mary to understand
what lay between them. And Mary did not understand;
the bewildered look she gave the pair told
Clifford that.</p>

<p>Hilton ended the brief tableau by picking up his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
hat and stick, which he had carried into the room
with him. “Good-afternoon, Mrs. Grayson; this
has been a most pleasant occasion. So-long, Loveman.”</p>

<p>He was turning away when Clifford sprang through
the doorway and upon him. Clifford seized his right
wrist and swung the arm upward and backward
with a vicious twist—an old police trick—and
thrust a hand through the flaring front of the exquisitely
tailored coat and possessed himself of the
bank-notes. Hilton’s stick and hat went flying; he
let out a cry of surprise and pain; but before he
knew what had happened to him there had snapped
about his wrists a pair of handcuffs.</p>

<p>Clifford jerked him forward, so that their faces
were within a foot of each other. “Well, Hilton,
this time I’ve got you with the goods on!” he
snapped. “This will be the last woman you’ll squeeze
money out of for about five years!”</p>

<p>“See here, I’ve done nothing,” gasped the
breathless Hilton. “That’s my own money—I
had it when I came here.”</p>

<p>Clifford turned to Mary. “I warned you what he
was—one of the cleverest of that new trade whose
specialty is squeezing big money out of women!”</p>

<p>“He’s done nothing,” Mary affirmed, looking directly
at Clifford. “You—how did you get in here?
I heard no ring.”</p>

<p>“Pass-key. That story doesn’t go, Mrs. Grayson—it
doesn’t go, Hilton. I was right on Hilton’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
heels when he entered. I heard him demand the
money on threat of exposure. I saw the money
passed.”</p>

<p>He turned abruptly on Loveman. “And you,
Loveman, you fit into this pretty little game, too!”</p>

<p>“Me, Bob, my dear boy?” protested Loveman.
“Why is it,” he demanded, in a tone of mourning,
“that the innocent bystander is the one that always
gets the copper’s stick over his new spring derby?”</p>

<p>“Your suspicions against Mr. Loveman—” began
Mary.</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word, Mrs. Grayson,” Loveman cut
in quickly.</p>

<p>“Your suspicions against Mr. Loveman are mistaken,”
persisted Mary. “Mr. Loveman gave me
that money.”</p>

<p>“Gave you the money!” exclaimed Clifford.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Grayson!” appealed Loveman.</p>

<p>But Mary went on, speaking very steadily and
with a formal precision. “You are right about
Mr. Hilton. He came yesterday afternoon, demanding
money which had to be paid by half-past five
to-day. I at first refused; afterwards I recognized
I didn’t dare not pay. I did not know where to
get such a sum, so I telephoned Mr. Loveman that
I wished to see him. He came at once, and I told
him of my situation and that I could not possibly
raise the amount upon such short notice. Jack did
not have the money, and I could not have asked
him for the amount, anyhow; and my uncle is away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
out on the coast. I asked Mr. Loveman’s advice.
He saw my predicament, and himself offered to give
me the money. Half an hour ago he came, bringing
the money which you have. I believe that completely
exonerates Mr. Loveman.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bob,” Loveman said cheerfully, “I guess
that lets me out.”</p>

<p>Clifford looked keenly at the little man’s round,
good-natured face—behind which played an unmatched
shrewdness. Clifford did not disbelieve
Mary, yet it seemed to him out of the man’s character
to play such a rôle as Mary had described.
This was one more aspect of the whole situation
which for the moment bewildered him.</p>

<p>“I think, Peter, we’ll soon figure out just where
you fit into this case,” he said shortly. He turned
to his prisoner. “At any rate, I’ve got you for fair,
Hilton,” he said grimly. “Loveman, kindly oblige
Mr. Hilton by picking up his stick and hat.”</p>

<p>“You may have me all right,” said Hilton, with
a pale, twitching smile that he tried to force to be
jauntily indifferent, “but when the evidence against
me is produced in court what will happen to Mrs.
Mary Regan Morton Grayson?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Bob,” Loveman spoke up quickly,
“call it square if he gives the money back to—”</p>

<p>But his words were cut off by the ringing of the
apartment bell. They all suddenly became as fixed
as so many statues. Then Mary spoke, and her
words came rapidly:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“It must be Jack, home from the office. He’s
probably forgotten his key. Mr. Loveman, you go
to the door and prevent his coming in. Say whatever
you like.”</p>

<p>Loveman slipped through the curtained doorway,
and the next moment Clifford heard the outer door
open. Then he heard an amazed voice exclaim:—</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s not Loveman! Now what the devil
are you doing here?”</p>

<p>Clifford and Mary both started. The amazed voice
in the next room was not Jack’s voice.</p>

<p>“I’m here—on a little business—with Mrs.
Grayson,” stammered Loveman.</p>

<p>“So am I,” said the voice.</p>

<p>“But she’s engaged—I assure you—”</p>

<p>“I’ll only take a minute or two. Come on; you
shall introduce me. Don’t hang back.”</p>

<p>The next moment Loveman was pushed through
the door, and behind him appeared the tall figure of
Mr. Morton, evening clothes showing beneath his
overcoat. He stopped short at what he saw.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Clifford!” he exclaimed. And then:
“Why, I beg your pardon, Miss Gilmore! Or should
I say Mrs. Grayson?”</p>

<p>Clifford saw that Mary had gone almost white.
He sensed, and he knew that she sensed, that one
of the supreme crises of her new life—the life that
was to make her or break her—was unexpectedly
before them.</p>

<p>Mary spoke calmly. “It is Mrs. Grayson now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“How rapidly events do happen in New York,”
Mr. Morton remarked politely, his keen gray eyes
full upon her. “Miss Gilmore when I saw you at
the Grantham—Mrs. Grayson within a week.
He must be a young Lochinvar, Mr. Grayson, the
way he does things.”</p>

<p>Hilton had been standing beyond Clifford, blocked
out of Mr. Morton’s first swift survey of the scene.
He now shifted forward, and Mr. Morton saw him,
the grip of Clifford fastened on his upper arm, and
the glinting handcuffs on his wrists.</p>

<p>“What’s this all about?” Mr. Morton exclaimed.</p>

<p>Hilton was swift to see what advantage for him
lay in the situation. He stepped nearer Mr. Morton.</p>

<p>“It means that I am the victim of a most unfortunate
misunderstanding,” he spoke up quickly.
“Mr. Clifford believed, mistakenly, that I had come
wrongfully by some five thousand dollars in my possession,
and he took the money from me and placed
me under arrest.”</p>

<p>“It’s none of my business, I suppose,” Mr. Morton
said, “but is this correct, Mr. Clifford?”</p>

<p>Clifford remained silent for a moment. In a flash
he saw that for him to answer with the full truth
would lead to Mary’s instant ruin: this after he had
declared that he had stepped out of her life, that he
was going to leave to experience and her own decisions
the shaping of her fate.</p>

<p>“The last part of his statement is correct,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
Clifford—“that I took the money from him and
placed him under arrest.”</p>

<p>“But he declares the money is his. If not, whose
is it?”</p>

<p>In the passing moment Clifford had decided to
put it squarely up to Mary, to thrust the tangled
threads of her destiny into her own hands. But
Hilton beat him to the very reply he intended
making.</p>

<p>“Ask Mrs. Grayson whose money it is,” cried
Hilton, and, wheeling, he gave Mary a meaning
look.</p>

<p>But Mr. Morton’s eyes waited on Clifford. Clifford
turned and gazed at Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes, ask Mrs. Grayson,” said Clifford.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Grayson,” said Mr. Morton, “the ownership
of this disputed money seems to rest on your
word.”</p>

<p>She hesitated. Clifford read beneath that white,
calm face: realized that she was on the thinnest of
thin ice—if indeed she were not already through
it and in the black waters. He believed, and was certain
she believed, that Mr. Morton already knew of
the marriage—but did he know of the other things?</p>

<p>“Whose is it, Mrs. Grayson?” prompted Mr.
Morton.</p>

<p>She indicated Hilton with a nod. “The money is
his; give it to him, Mr. Clifford,” she said.</p>

<p>Clifford quickly weighed his conflicting responsibilities.
To give Life the chance to test Mary out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
to the end of this experience weighed more important
than the mere capture of Hilton.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” he said; and thrust the bills into one
of the handcuffed hands—and as he did so, out of
the tail of his eye he caught a look of dismay on
Loveman’s face.</p>

<p>“Since your affairs seem to be adjusted,” put in
Mr. Morton, “I dare say you’d like to be saying
good-afternoon.”</p>

<p>Clifford removed the handcuffs, Loveman gave
Hilton his hat and cane, and the professional entangler
of women, though ruffled somewhat as to the
perfection of his apparel, bowed himself out with
exquisite manner.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence—a strain upon
all except Mr. Morton, who had the light, easy bearing
of a man of the world at an afternoon tea. If he
knew or guessed anything, he did not show it—and
his pleasant surface made him seem all the more
dangerous.</p>

<p>He gave Mary a slight but gracious bow. “I hope
you’ll forgive my dropping in so informally. But I
had learned your address by chance, I happened to
be in the neighborhood, and I wished to advance
my acquaintance, begun when you were Miss Gilmore.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’m glad you called,” returned Mary.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have a little visit—yes?” He
slipped off his overcoat. “Mr. Clifford, I know Mrs.
Grayson would be glad to have you remain as our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
chaperone. Mr. Loveman”—with the faintest of
ironic smiles—“I know I would not have a ghost
of a chance with such a famous lady’s man in the
company, so I am going to have the audacity to ask
you to call again.”</p>

<p>He had spoken with lightness, but there had been
autocratic demand behind his words. Loveman disappeared
into the room whence Clifford had seen him
emerge, and returned with hat and coat. He tried to
speak an offhand good-bye—though Clifford read
that his soul was agitated with acute uneasiness—and
started out.</p>

<p>“I’ll be back in a moment,” Clifford said to the
two, and followed the little lawyer. He caught him
in the hallway and held him with a hand on either
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Loveman,” said he, looking down into the round
face, “I certainly was up in the air for a time. But
I’ve sized up the whole situation now.”</p>

<p>“What situation?”</p>

<p>“The situation between you, Miss Regan,—Mrs.
Morton, I mean,—and Hilton. I thought that, of
course, you, Bradley, and Hilton were in the game
together.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I thought there was just one scheme on foot to
blackmail Mrs. Morton. I’ve just tumbled to the
fact that there were two schemes—and that there’s
just been a head-on collision between the two.”</p>

<p>“Bob, my boy, please elucidate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“Further, Loveman, I understand your generosity
in the matter of that five thousand. Bradley had
demanded money, and you knew it. When Mary
Regan sent for you yesterday, told you of the demand,
and convinced you she could not possibly
meet it, you had an inspiration. It wouldn’t do to
withdraw the demand; better to give her the money
yourself, and thereby increase her confidence and
gratitude—that’d make her more inclined to fall in
with you when you wanted to use her in some other
big game. And your five thousand which you’d
given her with your right hand, after she’d had it
for just a few minutes, would come right back to
your left hand. A great idea, Loveman!—great
stuff!”</p>

<p>“You’re smoking too much hop,” smiled Loveman—but
it was a sickly smile.</p>

<p>“But there’s many a slip ’twixt the right hand
and the left. You never suspected that there was a
second blackmailer on the job; Mrs. Morton probably
thought that Bradley and Hilton were working
together, and told you little more than that money
was demanded. And Hilton has walked right off
with your five thousand, and you’ll not get it back.
And your client in there, Mr. Morton, is on to Jack
and Mary Regan, and the part you’ve played, and
there’s about to be an explosion, and the rest of
your beans’ll be spilled. Good-night, Peter, old
boy, and may you have pleasant dreams!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>MR. MORTON TAKES A HAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> thought of the sickly-smiling Loveman, and
all his ironic jocularity, slipped from Clifford as he
stepped back into the graver situation which existed
in the drawing-room. The pair had seated themselves
during his absence; Mary was regarding Mr. Morton
with a composure that must have heavily taxed
her nervous capital.</p>

<p>Clifford took a chair slightly apart. He felt that
he had become merely an onlooker. The scene was
to be played out between Mr. Morton and Mary.
He judged that the easy manner of Mr. Morton was
a ruthless fury, marvelously controlled. Watching
them, he pulsed with suspense as to how Mary
would bear herself during this scene, as to how it
would come out.</p>

<p>Clifford had found them silent when he had reëntered,
and this silence, pregnant with big drama,
continued for a moment longer. Then Mr. Morton
smiled.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in beating about the bush, Mrs.
Grayson. It’s awfully hard on the shrubbery. So
I’ll come to the point. Of course you know why
I’m here.”</p>

<p>“You said you came to renew your acquaintance
with Miss Gilmore,” she managed to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Oh, that, of course. But there’s another reason.
You see”—with his pleasant smile—“I happen
to know Mr. Grayson.”</p>

<p>(Why in God’s name, Clifford asked himself,
didn’t the man set loose the anger and denunciation
and defiance customary in such situations, and not
play this cat-and-mouse game!)</p>

<p>“And Mr. Grayson being such a good friend,”
Mr. Morton continued, “in fact, a most intimate
friend, I naturally was most eager to become acquainted
with Mrs. Grayson. Please do not consider
that I am descending to mere flattery, Mrs.
Grayson, when I say that I applaud his taste.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“I do not mean to depreciate him, but he has
shown a finer discrimination than I thought Mr.
Grayson capable of.”</p>

<p>Clifford saw Mary stiffen. He knew her instinct
to rush forth to meet an inevitable danger.</p>

<p>“I also do not believe in beating about the bush,”
she said quietly. “We both are aware that in speaking
of Mr. Grayson we are speaking of your son.”</p>

<p>The veiled keenness in Mr. Morton’s eyes became
open. “I perceive, Mrs. Grayson, that you are not
only beautiful, but that you are an unusual woman.”
He did not speak for a moment; then, “Let me add
that I not only applaud Jack’s taste, but approve
his choice.”</p>

<p>Both Clifford and Mary started. “You approve
Jack’s choice!” she breathed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“How could I help it?” he returned.</p>

<p>Clifford and Mary could only stare at him. They
had expected outraged fury—and this had come!
They were so dazed that they did not know Jack
had entered until he stammered:—</p>

<p>“Father—you here!”</p>

<p>“The evidence indicates such, my boy,” returned
the elder Morton.</p>

<p>“Why—why—” He looked about, frightened,
helpless, at the three; and then stammered on: “I
went to the Biltmore to meet you, as you telephoned;
but they told me you were out, and I thought I’d
run up here for a minute and then get back—”</p>

<p>“My engagement with you,” interrupted Mr.
Morton, “was merely a fatherly subterfuge to keep
you away from here while I had a little visit with
Mrs. Grayson.”</p>

<p>“Then”—he choked, swallowed—“then you
know everything?”</p>

<p>“Not everything. But I know the essentials.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!” And Jack collapsed almost bonelessly
into a chair and covered his face with his
hands.</p>

<p>“Come, brace up—there’s nothing to worry
about,” half growled Clifford.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Jack,” explained Mary. “Your
father says he approves your choice!”</p>

<p>Jack was on his feet as though an electric current
had hurled him upright. “Is that so, dad?”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>In two eager steps Jack was across the room
wringing his father’s hand. “You don’t know how
relieved I am!”</p>

<p>“Why should you think I’d object after really
meeting Mrs. Grayson?”</p>

<p>“Call her Mary, dad.”</p>

<p>“Mary, then, with your permission. Plainly Mary
is a young woman of exceptional sense, and I am
sure she and I will understand each other splendidly.”</p>

<p>Jack crossed swiftly to Mary. “Mary!” he exclaimed,
seizing her hands, “Mary!” And then in
a lower voice, though Clifford heard him: “It’s all
coming true, Mary,—it’s all coming true!”</p>

<p>The Golden Doors had marvelously swung open!</p>

<p>Mr. Morton was speaking again: “Let’s get back
to sensible talk—which is what I came here for. I
wish to commend your discretion in this matter.
Boys will be boys, but usually they’re boys in such
a noisy way. I’m sure the discretion was yours,
Mary.”</p>

<p>“Discretion? I don’t know what you mean,” said
Mary.</p>

<p>“I mean that you have done everything so well,”
he continued pleasantly. “You’ve not laid the affair
open to instant recognition by thoughtlessly flaunting
yourself about with Jack. You’ve even taken
the precaution of wearing the conventional rings.
It’s the Riverside Drive affair done in the best
Riverside-Drive-affair manner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Clifford saw Mary go white again, and whiter
than before, as Mr. Morton spoke; and he thought
she was going to fall as she gathered the meaning
of his words—gathered what, since he had first entered,
had been his real conception of the relationship.</p>

<p>“But, dad—” began Jack in a throaty voice.
“You don’t know what you’re saying! You don’t
understand. The truth is—”</p>

<p>“Jack!” cut in Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do understand,” his father assured
him. “And don’t try to shield Mary with protestations.
She doesn’t need such flimsy protection.”</p>

<p>“Dad,” demanded the young fellow huskily,
“what do you think this situation is?”</p>

<p>“The obvious and usual one: you’re living here
together; as they always say it on the stage, she’s
your mistress.”</p>

<p>He turned to Mary. “Jack’s a sentimentalist.
But you’re a sensible woman and don’t humbug
yourself by hesitating to call a thing by its right
name.”</p>

<p>His last words were an even-toned affirmation
of a commonplace, not a question. Clifford watched
Mary closely: of a certainty, Life was testing her!
He waited tensely for her reply, and so did Jack—and
Clifford realized what vague worlds of different
events hung upon the words yet within her lips.</p>

<p>“I am Jack’s mistress—yes,” she said, looking
very straight into Mr. Morton’s eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“Mary, that’s—”</p>

<p>“Jack!” she ordered sharply.</p>

<p>“There’s no nonsense about you, Mary,” said
Mr. Morton approvingly. “Jack has braced up so
much recently—”</p>

<p>“If I have braced up, it’s been because Mary
has made me!” put in Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it, and I want to thank you,
Mary. He’s braced up so much that a long-contemplated
marriage, which has been delayed by his
irresponsibility, can now go through; and I want it
settled and over with, quick, while Jack is still in
a reformed mood—before he breaks loose again. I
know you’ll be sensible and reasonable about this
matter, for I know you went into the affair knowing
it could not last.”</p>

<p>Jack seized his father’s arm. “Father, you’ve
got to listen—”</p>

<p>“Jack!” Mary again cried peremptorily.</p>

<p>“She’s taking it with a lot more sense than you
are, son. I’ll see that you have no reason to complain,
Mary. I’ll ask Mr. Clifford to talk over the
arrangement with you. He can speak in better
taste for me than I can speak for myself.”</p>

<p>He took her hand, and there was a very real admiration—of
its sort—in his gray eyes. He spoke
in a lowered voice.</p>

<p>“Merely because Jack must go, I don’t want it to
be the end of things between you and the Mortons.
I hope I may have the pleasure of seeing you soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“Perhaps,” said her lips.</p>

<p>“I shall count on it!”—pressing her hand.</p>

<p>He turned away. “Well, son, are you ready?
I’ve made an engagement for you for to-night.”</p>

<p>But Jack sprang to Mary’s side, and seized in
both of his the hand his father had just relinquished.
His handsome if weak face was working with indignant,
protesting passion; for the moment he was
strong and sincere and fine to the capacity of his
nature.</p>

<p>“Mary, I’m not going to stand for this! I’m not
going to leave you in this way—I’m not that kind
of a rat!”</p>

<p>“We’re going to do just as your father says, Jack,”
she said with quiet dominance, her face very pale.
“What he suggests is wisest for us all.”</p>

<p>Jack stared at her; he could not read whether
there was subterfuge or utter finality in her words.
But whatever her purpose, he recognized that in
this situation her way had to be his. His figure
slumped down, and he turned about.</p>

<p>“Put into a suitcase whatever you may need at
once; you can send for your other things,” said his
father, and pressed him through the door. “Mary,
after a few minutes in the next room with me, Mr.
Clifford will return for a talk with you. For myself
this must be good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night.”</p>

<p>Bowing, he went out. As Clifford—mere audience—followed
him, he saw that Mary stood unchanged:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
stiffly erect, and pale and composed—though
he had a sense that her dark eyes were
unnaturally wide.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When Clifford reëntered the room fifteen minutes
later, Mary was lying face downward on the couch,
her whole figure taut. She heard him come in, and
at once spoke, not changing her posture:—</p>

<p>“You’ve been talking all this while?”</p>

<p>“We spoke for only a few minutes. The rest of
the time I’ve been sitting in there, thinking.” Then,
with a savage burst: “I wouldn’t have let Morton
use me, only I wanted to see you again!”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He told me to settle with you on any reasonable
terms.” Clifford stopped and waited, but she
did not speak. “Want to know what he might possibly
give?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“What else did he say?” she asked, not moving.</p>

<p>“A lot of things—to the general effect that you
were a damned decent, square little sport.”</p>

<p>She made no response to this.</p>

<p>“Why did you accept the position he put you
in, of being Jack’s mistress?” he burst out roughly.</p>

<p>“I could not help myself—unless I wanted to
ruin everything.”</p>

<p>“Surely you do not still hope to save that situation?”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She did not answer, and again there was silence.
Then the doorbell rang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Shall I answer it?” he asked. “It’s probably
Jack slipped up for a private word.”</p>

<p>“I’ll answer it,” she said.</p>

<p>She rose from the couch. He had expected signs
of conflict, agony, perhaps tears or hysteria;—if
only there should be a real outbreak of hysteria!
But her face was composed and clear-eyed.</p>

<p>She returned a moment later, bearing a large box,
on its top in gilded letters the name of the florist who
had a shop opening on the Mordona’s lobby. She
removed the lid and disclosed a rich mass of orchids.
On their top lay a small envelope such as florists
have in stock for the convenience of patrons. From
this she drew a card, which she read and then
passed to Clifford without comment. It was Mr.
Morton’s card, and on its two sides was closely
written:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am going to be a lonely man to-morrow. Won’t you
save me from myself by dining with me at the Ritz?—and
then an act or two of a play, and then supper wherever
you like? I’ll telephone you.—The West Indies are
heaven just now, and I’m thinking of chartering a yacht.
A cruise of a month or so in those waters— But shall
we talk it over to-morrow night?</p>
</div>

<p>Clifford gazed at her, automatically handing her
back the card. Rage surged up in him, and he seized
the box from her arms and, stepping to the window
near which they stood, he raised it, and threw far
out into the Drive some fifty dollars’ worth of orchids.
He drew down the window and turned back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
her. But her look expressed neither approval nor
disapproval.</p>

<p>“Well, you see where you are!” he said grimly.
“And you once called them the Golden Doors!”</p>

<p>She nodded, but otherwise did not respond. Her
face, fixed absently on his, was intently thoughtful.</p>

<p>Her silence, her control, her look of far-away
thought, stirred both anger and consuming curiosity.
“Well—what are you going to do? What’s the
way out?”</p>

<p>“It’s not the way out I’m thinking of—it’s
the way in,” she returned slowly, quietly. “The
Golden Doors are going to open.”</p>

<p>“Open! How?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Through that Mr. Mor—” he was beginning,
when he noticed that her fingers had mechanically
torn the card across.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” she repeated quietly. “But
they are going to open. And now, please go—I
want to think.”</p>

<p>He gazed at her a moment, marveling that such
unforeseen manipulations of Life, Life the great
moulder and remoulder, had not seemed to change
her ambition, her pride, her will, her girlish confidence:
he understood her—yet she was the eternal
mystery! Then he left her, standing in the middle
of the hired drawing-room, mechanically tearing
into tiny sifting flakes the invitation to a voyage
among perfumed seas.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>MARY FACES A CRISIS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Clifford</span> had just gone, and Mary now sat alone
in the ornate drawing-room which for a brief week
she had occupied as “Mrs. Grayson,” and considered
rapidly the situation in which her own will and the
unforeseen working-out of life and human nature
had, within the last half-hour, suddenly placed her.
Concrete questions, with their inseparable difficulties
and dangers, rushed upon her: What was
Clifford going to do? What was Jack going to do,
whose mistress she had just declared herself to be
before his father? And what would be the next move
of Jack’s father, amiable forgiver of what he considered
Jack’s discreet liaison, whose invitation to
a yachting tour for two among West Indian seas
lay in tiny fragments upon the floor?—which invitation,
she knew, he would soon repeat and press for
an answer. And most especially, just what was she
going to do herself to make her way safely through
all these dangers which beset her plans?</p>

<p>Again she recalled Clifford’s grim words: he was
through interfering with her, he was going to leave
it to Life, to the shaping forces of Life’s experiences,
to make her or ruin her. Well, she was going to show
him! She was going to make Life her tool, her ally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
her servant—she was going to bend all its currents
to carry her in the direction of her desire!</p>

<p>And then for a space she felt herself at a loss in
this new turn of affairs. She felt the instant need
of the guidance of some one near to her. Clifford?
No, she would have nothing to do with him now.
Her brother Slant-Face? But her present situation
was not the sort in which the skill of her brother,
whom discretion had necessitated her neglecting,
could possibly avail her. And then she thought of
Uncle George. He was her friend, he would understand
her; and no one could give more shrewd counsel,
could plan more cunningly, than this urbane
old master of the follies of the world and of the
stratagems by which the world could be made to
believe his wishes to be its own inborn desires. Yes,
she would call in Uncle George.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, she had a different vision of
her situation. For the present, at least, she must
act alone. She arose quickly. These questions that
had been so prompt to ask themselves, those dangers
that had presented themselves so vividly, they
indeed pressed her sorely; but most pressing of all,
she decided, was that she should move from here
where all could find her to some obscure hotel, where
she might remain undiscovered for a few days and
have time in which to plan and act. She ordered the
trunks up; and at once, with the help of her maid,
she set about the packing, which was quickly finished
since she and Jack had brought nothing to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
richly furnished apartment except their clothes. All
her own things for which she would have an early
need she put into one steamer trunk and a bag.</p>

<p>She had changed into a traveling-suit, had paid and
sent away her maid, and was standing in the hall of
the apartment watching the baggageman tag the
trunks and taking from him the claim checks, when
the apartment door opened and in stepped Jack.</p>

<p>He stared at Mary, at the trunks, at the change
that had been made in their brief home since he
had left it two hours before. But he stood quietly
at one side, until the baggageman had shuffled into
the corridor with a trunk humped upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Mary, what does this mean?” he demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>“I’m just leaving; I haven’t time to tell you
now. I’ll write you or telephone you.”</p>

<p>She started past him, but he caught her arm.
“Mary, I’m going to know this now! And I’m going
to understand everything else!”</p>

<p>He was white, and so wrought up with excitement
that she perceived that whatever problems she might
be facing, the most pressing and the most dangerous
was the barely suppressed frenzy of the young man
before her—which frenzy, if not controlled and
insulated, might bring about an explosion and cause
half a dozen other explosions. “Come on,” she said,
and led the way from the stack of trunks through the
drawing-room, so recently the scene of unforgettable
drama, into the study, where there was a heavy door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
that gave privacy and in which minor explosions
could take place unheard. Jack closed the door, and
stood with his back against it—a tense, white, haggard
figure, made to seem all the more haggard by
the contrast of the unemotional formality of evening
clothes.</p>

<p>“I was at dinner with father and Maisie Jones—she’s
the girl they want to marry me to—and a
few others, but I managed to give them the slip!”
he said rapidly, by way of explaining his presence.
“Tell me”—his burning eyes were fixed on her—“what
do those trunks mean?”</p>

<p>She told him the truth; not the whole of it, but
what she did tell was true enough.</p>

<p>“You’re not going to do anything of the sort!”
he declared. “But we won’t argue that point now.
First tell me this—why, in the name of God, when
my father discovered you here at the Mordona two
hours ago, did you admit that you were my mistress?
Yes, and made me admit it!”</p>

<p>She spoke quietly, hoping to calm him by her
reasonable voice. “It began with your father’s mistaken
conception of our relations. His mistake saved
us. It would have been foolish not to have fallen in
with his mistake. Surely you understand that?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t understand it, and it made me sick!”
he cried. “I backed you up, just because I knew you
wanted me to. But I’m not going to stand any
longer for this lying, this living in secret! I’m going
to end it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“End it? How?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to let my father, or any one else,
think of you as my mistress! I’m going to tell him
we’re married! And from now on everything’s going
to be in the open!”</p>

<p>She had never liked him more than just then.
Whatever else he might be in the future, she would
never be able to forget him as he was at this his
highest moment—frenzied, outraged, dominated by
reckless impulse. But she saw the danger to her
dreams in this attitude.</p>

<p>“It’s fine of you to say that, Jack, but you must
not do it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” he demanded.</p>

<p>She strove to keep her reasoning, soothing tone.
“It ought to be plain to you, Jack. You are entirely
dependent on your father. If he were told of our
marriage—particularly since he’s so eager to have
you marry that other girl—he’d be sure to cut you
off in every way, and I’m not going to have that
happen to you.” Within herself she was also saying
that if Mr. Morton were told of the marriage, and
if she and Jack lived in the open, father and son
would inevitably and swiftly learn who she really
was—and that would end everything. “We must
keep it all quiet, Jack,” she went on, “and keep on
waiting, and after a time we’ll have our chance to
win your father around. You leave it to me.”</p>

<p>His face had suddenly darkened at mention of
his father. “What did Clifford offer you in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
father’s behalf, after we’d gone?” he demanded
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Clifford told me that your father would give
me in settlement any sum I might mention.”</p>

<p>“And your reply to that?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t make any reply. There was none.”</p>

<p>“He’ll expect a reply. He’ll come for it himself,
if necessary.”</p>

<p>“That’s one reason for my moving—because I
knew he would come.”</p>

<p>“Was that all dad offered?” Jack demanded.
“You made a big hit with him.”</p>

<p>She thought it best that the inflammable youth
should remain ignorant of the father’s invitation,
convoyed by orchids each worth a bank-note, to the
supposedly disespoused mistress of his son to join
him in a very exclusive cruise.</p>

<p>“That was all that happened,” she answered
steadily.</p>

<p>Quickly, but without seeming haste, she shifted
from this dangerous subject, back to their difference.
“Of course you agree, Jack,” she pressed him, “that
we must still keep things quiet, and keep on waiting?”</p>

<p>His desperate mood was instantly back upon him
again. “Even if we could keep up that pretense,”
he cried,—“why, you’re forgetting Maisie Jones!
You’re forgetting my predicament!”</p>

<p>“Your predicament?”</p>

<p>“I can’t keep it quiet, even if I want to! Don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
you see? Now that I’ve settled down into a steady
business man—your doing!—all parties are willing
that Maisie and I should at once be formally engaged
and then be married in a very short time.
Father’s pushing it across as though it were a big
option that expired to-morrow. Get the fix that
puts me in? There are only three things for me to do.
Run away from it all, in which case dad’ll be done
with me as long as he lives. Or say I won’t go
through with the thing with Maisie, and give no
reasons—which means the same result. Or else
come right out with the truth that I’m married to
you. See my fix?”</p>

<p>Mary saw; and swiftly judging her many-angled
situation she saw that, however pressing other
matters might be, this matter of the other girl was
the first business that must be somehow adjusted
if she were to realize her vaulting dreams—if she
were to pass through the Golden Doors. And as
she perceived this, she had an instant’s realization,
that this business of gaining the worldly heights,
which had at the inception of her plan seemed so
simple and easily achievable, was every day becoming
more complicated, more tortuous. Again Clifford’s
grim words flashed briefly back: “I’ll leave
it to Life to test you.”...</p>

<p>“So, you see, I might just as well come across with
the truth about our marriage!” Jack exclaimed.
“It’s the best way out of the fix!”</p>

<p>Mary hardly heard him; she was rapidly considering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
this new problem. “You’ve never told me how it
came about, this arrangement with Miss Jones.”</p>

<p>“Oh, just the way such matters usually happen.
Maisie and I have known each other for a long time;
there’s been a sort of unspoken understanding in our
families that some day we’d get married—and I
guess I fell right in with it. You see, I rather liked
Maisie, and I’d never thought much about such
affairs, and it didn’t make much difference. But—well,
you know, I haven’t been behaving very
well; and her people said there’d be nothing doing
unless I straightened out. Since you’ve set me to
work and kept me working, they’ve recalled their
veto—and it’s all right with them. That’s about
the size of the situation.”</p>

<p>“What’s her attitude toward you?”</p>

<p>“Maisie’s? I guess Maisie rather likes me. In
fact,” he confessed, “though I don’t deserve it,
Maisie really likes me a lot.”</p>

<p>“What’s she like?” Mary asked quickly.</p>

<p>“You mean looks, or—or personally?”</p>

<p>“Personally.”</p>

<p>“Maisie’s an awfully fine girl,” he answered
soberly.</p>

<p>“Does she have any special interest?—something
through which an appeal might be made to
her?”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand?”</p>

<p>Mary saw that for her purpose, it might not help
any if he did understand. “Where is she staying?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“At the Grantham.”</p>

<p>“Who’s with her?”</p>

<p>“An aunt; her father’s sister, who thinks she
manages Maisie. But Maisie does just as she pleases.—
But what are you driving at with all these questions
about Maisie?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know myself yet. You can avoid committing
yourself for a few days?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I can stall for that much longer.”</p>

<p>“Then listen, Jack,—here’s just what we’ve
got to do,” she said rapidly, dominantly. “No
matter what you think, or feel, we’ve got to keep
our affair quiet for the present, and go ahead just
as we originally planned, except that you’re to stay
with your father. I’ll not consent to any other arrangement,
so it’s no use arguing. You go every day
to your office just as you’ve been doing; I’ll call
you up there when I want you. And don’t be surprised
at anything you see.”</p>

<p>“But what are you going to do, Mary?” he insisted.</p>

<p>“I don’t just know yet; I’ll let you know when
I do. If we keep our nerve it will all come out all
right. Here are the claim checks to your trunks:
I have ordered all the baggage sent to the Grand
Central Station. You must go now, Jack,—you
really must!”</p>

<p>She fairly pressed the bewildered, unwilling Jack
from the apartment; and then for a few moments
she stood in the hall, now cleared of her luggage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
rapidly planning. Then she shot down the elevator
and hurried out of the Mordona to a taxi,—fortunately
just missing Loveman, who she knew was
coming here to see her,—and some twenty minutes
later, again registered at the Grantham as “Mrs.
Gardner.” She was the occupant of a suite on the
same corridor as Miss Maisie Jones, and had ordered
her trunks brought from the Grand Central Station.</p>

<p>Settled here, she continued her planning. There
seemed no end to the plans that had to be thought
out, to the dangers that must be eluded and averted.
And yet she felt confident—very confident.</p>

<p>But mixed with her confidence was an intermittent
apprehension. She believed she had avoided
the others. But Clifford—if Clifford would only
not interfere.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>LOVEMAN SHOWS HIS CLAWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the next morning came, and as yet there had
been no signs of Clifford.</p>

<p>At half-past ten Mary rang at the door of Maisie
Jones. Her plan for beginning their acquaintance
was very simple, merely the adaptation of an ancient
device belonging to her past with her father
and her Uncle Joe Russell—the preparation of two
letters addressed to Miss Maisie Jones, which were
in fact nothing more than modistes’ engraved invitations
to inspect new spring styles.</p>

<p>Miss Jones herself answered Mary’s ring. “My
name’s Mrs. Gardner—these letters somehow got
mixed in my mail,” Mary began, smiling with the
engaging frankness she knew how to assume. “I
could have returned them to you by the maid; but
the maid—it seems you and I have the same maid—told
me that your aunt was ill, and I thought I’d
bring them myself and make it an excuse to do such
an un-New-Yorkish thing as to ask how a sick neighbor
is.”</p>

<p>“Aunt’s not seriously ill,” said Maisie Jones.</p>

<p>“But I suppose her illness means that you must
stay pretty close to your rooms?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“I can sympathize with you. I’m convalescing
from pneumonia, and am supposed to rest the whole
time. To confess the truth to you”—with a smile
of guiltily humorous candor—“my real reason for
bringing the letters myself was that I saw in it a few
minutes’ relief from this awful boredom of getting
well.”</p>

<p>Miss Jones hesitated. “Won’t you please come in?”</p>

<p>Mary entered. The rest was natural development,
a development which with her skill she made rapid.
She was humorously frank about herself, and from
personal bits which she adroitly dropped here and
there, she let Miss Jones gather that she was the
daughter of a New York family who moved among
the city’s smarter set, that her husband was in the
far West, on business, and that the other members
of the family—they were an irrational and self-centered
lot—were at Florida and California
resorts gratifying their various individual predilections.</p>

<p>Frankness begot frankness. Maisie Jones, a shut-in,
was most willing to talk; but Mary, though making
a show of lively interest in what was said, was
shrewdly studying the girl. Maisie was strikingly
handsome—a specimen of the American girl who
has been through a fashionable school and then had
a successful year or two in society. Mary catalogued
the qualities her plans must take account of: she was
spoiled, willful, proud, jealous—possibly vindictive.</p>

<p>This first study of Maisie completed, and the opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
made for future meetings, Mary started back to
her suite, thrilling with confidence. Her plan was
under way! And she was going to succeed, even
though she was going it alone!</p>

<p>But when she entered her sitting-room, she
stopped short. For from a chair had risen the smiling
person of Peter Loveman.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, my dear,” said the little lawyer.</p>

<p>“How did you get here?” she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>“I told the people at the desk—I know ’em all
here—that you’d telephoned for me, and had
asked me to come right up. Your door was not
locked. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“But how did you know I was staying here?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you were followed from the Mordona
last night,” he answered placidly.</p>

<p>“How many know this?”</p>

<p>“Two or three—not many more,” answered the
little lawyer.</p>

<p>So then she was not to have her few unmolested
days in which to mature and execute her present designs.
Her dangers were in point of time closer to
her than she had thought. Well, she must work all
the more quickly, all the more skillfully.</p>

<p>She seated herself, and he resumed his chair. “Of
course you’ve come here for a reason, Mr. Loveman.
What is it?”</p>

<p>“That was a fine little idea, Mary, we originally
worked out for this affair,” he began amiably—“for
you to marry Jack Morton, keep the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
quiet until you were fixed solid with Jack, and until
conditions developed so that you could win over
his father. Yes, a fine little idea. It would have
landed you at the top, where nothing ever could
have touched you.”</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of now?” she asked
sharply.</p>

<p>“Nothing, my dear,—only we both know that
fine little idea has had a great fall, and all the
king’s horses and all of God’s angels can’t ever put
that idea together again.”</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of?” she repeated.</p>

<p>He did not reply at once, but smiled affably and
softly rubbed his hairless crown. The shrewdest
brain of its kind in New York had done a lot of thinking
in the last sixteen hours. Certainly the first
stages of the plan, the plan as he had planned it for
himself, had fallen down calamitously. And he had
seen the further stages of the plan (as the plan, unknown
to Mary, concerned him) menaced with sudden
danger—and had seen even himself, personally,
on the brink of uncalculated misfortune.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it plain what I’m thinking of, Mary?”
he said after a moment. “After what happened
yesterday, it doesn’t count for much that for the
time you made Mr. Morton believe you were only
Jack’s mistress. He’s certain to learn the facts very
shortly; your whole plan is the same as exploded.
You may stave off the end for a day, two days—but
hardly longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>She refrained from speaking of her present enterprise.
“What do you think we ought to do?”</p>

<p>“This has always been a business proposition for
you,” he replied in his amiable, reasoning manner,
“and the way things have turned, it naturally is
going to be a business proposition for me—Mr.
Morton being my client, you know. So let’s consider
how we can make the most out of it. Now,
first item, Mr. Morton is bound to find out the truth
in a few days. If he finds it out for himself, nobody’s
going to profit. We simply lose, say, ten thousand
dollars. My first proposition—this is small money,
of course—is that we arrange to beat Mr. Morton
to this discovery. You know, for some time I have
been under directions from Mr. Morton to follow
up Jack’s doings. Now, let’s say that to-morrow I
turn in a report that the detectives I’ve employed
have just discovered that Jack is married—which
will mean a bill for detective service of at least ten
thousand. Right there is ten thousand saved out
of the ruin. Of course I’ll split it with you.”</p>

<p>Mary managed to control her expression; she saw
a few things regarding Loveman she had not suspected.
“And after that?”</p>

<p>“Of course Mr. Morton will want to institute
proceedings for a divorce, and naturally I’ll be
retained as his attorney. You’ll make him pay big
for the separation; and I being on the inside can
tell you the limit that you can make him pay
over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>He smiled at her genially as though it were a
settled matter which Mary’s good sense would applaud.
Now that the time had come to do business,
and since he considered that Mary was in this with
him, he had not hesitated to reveal a fragment of his
method as a specialist in domestic affairs—which
was to play both ends and every point between.
Smiling, he expectantly awaited Mary’s approval.</p>

<p>“And after that’s done, then what becomes of
me?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear, it will be handled so that you’ll
come out of the proceedings with a pretty fair reputation
and holding tight to the name of Mrs. Jack
Morton. With such a handsome woman as you
are, and such a start, there’s nothing I couldn’t
do with you if you privately put yourself under my
direction! Nothing!”</p>

<p>He rubbed his soft, finely manicured hands in
excited anticipation, and let his speech run free.
“Honest, Mary, this is the big thing I’ve seen in this
business from the beginning. I never thought anything
really big or permanent would develop from
that marriage. Compared to other prospects, that
was only pin-money—only the starter—only the
prologue. The curtain really goes up when we’re
through with this. Mary, my dear, if I were to tell
you what I’ve done for some women in this town—you’d
certainly sit up! I don’t know now just
what I’ll do with you; I’m an opportunist—I always
play for the biggest chance that comes along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
at a given time, or for the biggest chance that I can
develop. But what I’ll do for you will be strictly
within the law—it may even be most thoroughly
respectable. I tell you, Mary,” he enthused, “with
me handling you, with my knowledge of New York
life and of the strings to pull, there is nothing I
can’t do for you!— I tell you nothing!”</p>

<p>His large eyes were shining on her brilliantly.
Rarely had this master of domestic intrigue, this
marvelously keen student of human nature and
subtle manipulator of human weakness and ambitions,
been stirred by his own excited imagination
to such a frank, if incomplete, statement of the
methods of his art. For a moment, despite herself,
Mary felt half carried away by the power of the
little man; saw herself for a moment as perhaps at
some future time being fitted into one of his amazing
plans.</p>

<p>“And for all this what would you expect?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Naturally a manager would expect a manager’s
share.” And as she did not respond, he prompted
her briskly: “Well, now, let’s get back to the first
proposition—though that’s mighty small peanuts.
I suppose to-morrow will suit you all right for me
to give Mr. Morton my detectives’ report that his
son is married?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“No! Why not? It won’t be safe to put it off any
longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Mr. Loveman,” she said quietly, looking at
him very steadily, “I’m going straight ahead with
the original plan.”</p>

<p>He sprang from his chair, fairly sputtering surprise.
“Why, you’re crazy! You can’t do it!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll fall down flat! You can’t possibly
keep this thing going for more than a day or two!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try,” she repeated.</p>

<p>“If you do, you’ll not only ruin yourself, but
you’ll ruin some more of us, too,” he said in consternation.
“Why, yesterday, when Mr. Morton
found me in your apartment at the Mordona, I had
the closest sort of shave. And now, if you try to keep
on with your plan, and the certain explosion comes,
don’t you see that Morton will learn that while retained
by him I’ve also been sitting in the game with
you? Don’t you see you’ll ruin me?”</p>

<p>“So that’s why you’ve come to me with these
new propositions?” she said keenly—“to save
your own skin?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said defiantly, “though those new propositions,
the last one at least, were always part of
the plan I’d had for you.”</p>

<p>They were now standing face to face, she almost
half a head the taller. “Peter Loveman,” she said
slowly, distinctly, “despite your skin, and my skin,
I’m going straight ahead.”</p>

<p>“What!” he exclaimed, astounded; and then:
“You can’t! There’s that explosion, due in a day or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
so—and after that you’ll be nothing but smoke
and dam’ thin smoke!”</p>

<p>“I have my own idea of how to do it, and I believe
I can succeed. Anyhow, I’m going straight ahead.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not!” he said sharply. In a moment
the usually amiable face had become grim with menace—and
few faces could be more truly menacing.
“If you won’t play this game with me, Mary Regan,
then this minute I cut you out of it and play the
game alone.”</p>

<p>“Just what does that mean?”</p>

<p>“It means that I’ll not get as much out of it as if
we worked together—but I’ll <i>get it, and get it certain</i>.
It means that in half an hour Mr. Morton will
have my detectives’ report telling of the discovery of
his son’s secret marriage and telling all about who
the wife is. And it means that I’ll handle the suit
for separation—and that I’ll collect for both services.
And it also means that I’ll deny, and deny
successfully, any statement that you may make as
to any relations between us. I guess that fixes you!”</p>

<p>“So, you’d do that!” she breathed, staring at him.
Then, without another word, she crossed to her desk
and took up the telephone. “Central, please give
me Broad 9000.”</p>

<p>In a moment Loveman was across the room and
had seized her arm. “That’s Mr. Morton’s office!”
he exclaimed. “What’re you up to?”</p>

<p>Giving him no heed, she spoke into the instrument.
“Is this Broad 9000?... Please tell Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
Morton, Senior, that Mrs. Grayson wishes to speak
to him.”</p>

<p>One of Loveman’s hands closed with a swift, spasmodic
grip over the telephone’s mouthpiece, the
other hand fiercely gripped Mary’s arm.</p>

<p>“What’s this you’re up to?” he demanded
huskily.</p>

<p>She gave him a calm, defiant look. For a moment
they stood so, silent, the telephone clutched by both
of them.</p>

<p>“I’m going to beat you to it—that’s all, Peter
Loveman. I’m going to telephone Mr. Morton about
Jack’s secret marriage and about who his wife is—and
there’ll be no big bill for detective services for
you. And I’m going to tell Mr. Morton that I shall
not oppose any kind of divorce or separation or
annulment proceedings, and that I shall not ask for
or accept one dollar in the way of settlement—and
that means there will be no big fee for you for handling
a difficult case. Out of this you’ll get exactly
nothing. Now, I guess that fixes you!”</p>

<p>His large eyes gazed at her with an almost super-penetration.
But there was no doubting that she
would do as she had said. His usually ruddy face,
gone pale the moment before, now took on a yellowish tinge.
Then he laughed with forced joviality,
and removed his hands from the telephone and her
arm.</p>

<p>“That certainly was once that one of my jokes
was taken seriously.” He laughed again. “Why, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
poor child—of course I wasn’t going to double-cross
you!”</p>

<p>She was not deceived by this swift change of front.
She knew that she had shown the higher card.</p>

<p>“Is what you say to be interpreted as meaning
that you will not interfere with my plans?”</p>

<p>“Go right on!” he said heartily.</p>

<p>“All right.” She hung the receiver on its hook
and set down the telephone. “But if ever there is
any interference which seems to come from you, I’ll
do exactly what I said.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Mary, forget my bit of gun-play. You
ought to know that I was only fooling.” He was
now thoroughly amiable again, as far as smile and
manner went. “Just how are you going to do it,
Mary?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to do it—that’s all I can definitely
say as yet. And now, I have a lot to think about—”</p>

<p>“And you’d like to have me go. All right, I’ll go.
But say, Mary,—you sure have nerve!” he exclaimed,
with a sincerity that was sincere. “Nerve,
and a lot of other things. And remember this: I’m
counting on putting you across, a little later, in the
way I just told you about. You’re just the woman
I could do it with—big! Big—you understand!
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>As the little lawyer went out, Mary took a deep
breath. That was one danger, and an unexpected
danger, that she had narrowly averted.... Her
quick, eager mind flashed ahead to a picture which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
his words had suggested: “Put you across—big!”
Perhaps later, if her present plans went awry, she
might want to be put across in some magnificent
way—who knew?—and Loveman was the one
man to do it.</p>

<p>But for the present, Peter Loveman was to be
trusted just so far as he could be trusted.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>THE STRINGS OF HUMAN NATURE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveman</span> had been gone no more than fifteen minutes,
and Mary was thinking upon her plans, balancing
this prospect against that danger, when her
telephone began to ring. She took it up, and to her
dismay the voice that greeted her over the wire
was the voice of Jack’s father. His first words she
did not hear at all—her senses were almost wholly
concentrated in dismay that two of the persons
from whom she had sought seclusion had within a
single hour learned of her whereabouts! How soon
before all would be about her again?</p>

<p>“How did you learn where I am?” she asked
automatically.</p>

<p>“Why, you called me up awhile ago, and said
Mrs. Grayson wanted to speak to me,” he replied.
“When I tried to answer, you had hung up. But Central
located the telephone the call had come from.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton went on to ask to see her at once—anyhow,
not later than luncheon. She considered
whether she should see him again, after her admission
of her liaison with Jack, after that orchid-smothered
invitation to a voyage in tropical waters—or
should she evade him by once more running
away? But running away would mean the abandonment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
of her plans involving Maisie Jones—and that
she could not do. Besides, at the best she would only
delay the meeting with Mr. Morton; the meeting
itself was inevitable.</p>

<p>While her lips replied to him, her mind considered
rapidly. Should she see him alone—or in public?
Only by a solitary meeting could she reduce the
ever-present danger of accident prematurely revealing
her identity to him; but a solitary meeting,
in view of what he supposed to be her character,
might prompt him to make open advances of a sort
suggested by his perfumed invitation—which
advances she dared neither permit nor too bluntly
repel. And then she thought of what might be a way
out—the small Japanese Room just off one of the
large dining-rooms: this would give her the protection
of both privacy and publicity. She suggested it
to Mr. Morton, and he promptly said he would reserve
the room and would meet her at half-past
twelve. “Please remember this,” she ended,—“here
at the Grantham I am known as Mrs. Gardner.”</p>

<p>She slipped down shortly after twelve, to avoid
the danger of recognition by any one in the crowd
of lunchers who would come in a little later. But as
she passed through a hallway on the main floor, she
glimpsed a square figure behind a newspaper—Bradley.
She went on without pause and slipped
into the Japanese Room. So Bradley, too, had
learned of her whereabouts!</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Mr. Morton entered, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
as sprucely young as fifty can look, smiling admiration
in the gray eyes that were more accustomed to a
gaze of autocratic command. Mary had previously
placed herself at the table so that she could see into
the larger room without being seen, and during the
preliminaries of their conversation her main faculties
were surreptitiously directed beyond the hangings.
Presently she saw Loveman enter the larger
room. Instinctively she knew Loveman had followed
Mr. Morton here, to keep close watch over
what he did and what might develop. After her
scene that morning with Loveman, she knew he
would strike the instant he saw she was failing, or
thought she was about to fail. Loveman and Bradley—her
seemingly simple plan certainly was growing
complicated!</p>

<p>And then a little later she saw Clifford enter. Her
heart skipped a few beats: so, then, he was watching
her, as she had expected! What might he intend
doing?... Well, whatever it might be, she would
go straight ahead!</p>

<p>Presently she had to give more heed to Morton,
for he was touching upon things that were vitally
personal. “Let me again applaud the discretion
you showed in your affair with Jack, Mrs. Gardner,”
he was saying. “And again let me compliment you
on your sensible attitude when you saw the affair
had to be broken off.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Pardon my referring to the sordid money side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
of things,” he went on. “I was prepared to meet
whatever you had in mind—but Mr. Clifford has
reported to me that you would accept no settlement.
I do not quite understand.”</p>

<p>“I did not enter into the affair with Jack expecting
to be bought off,” she replied.</p>

<p>He looked at her keenly, but said no more on the
subject. “There is one thing that has surprised me
a bit, though, in so discreet a woman as you are,
Mrs. Gardner: that is, your coming to the very
hotel at which Miss Jones is staying.”</p>

<p>“It is the hotel at which I usually stop.”</p>

<p>“I was merely thinking that your being under
the same roof might lead to some unexpected happening
that would let Miss Jones learn—you understand.
But you are very sensible and careful.”</p>

<p>He leaned over the little table. “And now let’s
talk about you and me,” he said softly. “What is
your answer?”</p>

<p>“My answer?” she evaded.</p>

<p>“To my suggestion that we explore a more amiable
climate—together.”</p>

<p>Her back was against the wall. “I’d rather not
have to answer.”</p>

<p>“But your mind is made up?”</p>

<p>She hesitated. “Yes,” she admitted. “But I’d
rather not speak—not just now.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“There may develop complications; complications
which I can’t now explain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“But at least,” he urged, “can’t you give me a
hint of what your answer will be, if complications
do not interfere?”</p>

<p>She thought rapidly. He was pressing her hard
from one direction, and outside sat Loveman, a
danger from another direction—watching her,
ready to expose and destroy her at the slightest
sign of failure. Of the two she just then feared Loveman
the more. She had to put Morton off—she had
to have some weapon against Loveman.</p>

<p>An idea flashed into her brain—a desperate idea,
but she was now playing a desperate game.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please give me a hint?” he insisted.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, with the air of one consenting,
“here is a proposition that may sound to you absurd—but
then a woman is supposed to be irrational.
For my own reasons I can’t now tell you what my
answer is, but I’ll write it out in a letter and give it
to you if you’ll promise not to read it until you have
my permission. That way you’ll always have my
answer with you. I may telephone or telegraph you,
when I’m ready for you to open the letter.”</p>

<p>“I promise,” he agreed.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll write it here,” she said.</p>

<p>The waiter brought heavy stationery, and with
Mr. Morton’s fountain pen she began to write.
He watched her closely until he was certain she was
engrossed in her note, then stealthily he possessed
himself of her handbag which she had left upon a
third chair beside the table. This he cautiously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
opened, and into it he slipped an envelope which he
took from his pocket. Then he closed the bag and
returned it to its place.</p>

<p>Mary finished her letter, thrust it into an envelope,
which she sealed. This she held tentatively
above the table.</p>

<p>“On your honor as a gentleman you promise not
to open this until I give you the word?”</p>

<p>“Promise? I swear!”</p>

<p>“And you promise not to try to be—too friendly
until I give you the word?”</p>

<p>“That comes hard—but I promise that, too.”</p>

<p>She held out the sealed envelope. He took it, and
also caught her hand.</p>

<p>“Even if I’m not allowed to read, I’m allowed
to guess—and hope,” he said softly; “and in the
meantime, I’m going to call on you now and
then—and for the sake of discretion, I’ll take
my chances and come unannounced.” And smiling
expectantly he slipped her letter into the inner
pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>A little later, when they had parted, she met
Uncle George near the elevators. It was evident
that he, too, had just finished lunching.</p>

<p>“Mary,” he said solemnly, “excuse me for not
having failing eyesight, as a man of incurable senility
should have—but really I couldn’t help lamping
the would-be gazelle you were eating with.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with my doing that?” she asked
defensively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Nothing at all, dear—nothing at all: only just
remember that no matter what his song is nor how
soft he sings it, he’s an old goat in a canary’s skin.”</p>

<p>“I believe I can manage him,” she returned confidently.</p>

<p>“I hope so, Mary—I hope so. But he’s descended
from one of the first families of Sodom and Gomorrah,
and he’s a wise party, and he knows what he
wants and he knows how to get it, and he usually
gets it, too.”</p>

<p>Uncle George paused a moment, then added:
“Excuse my seeing it, dear—I’ve got the habit of
seeing things and can’t break it. But did you notice
that he put something in your bag?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then if you don’t believe my old eyes, you might
take a look for yourself.”</p>

<p>She opened her bag. There was the envelope
Mr. Morton had slipped into it, unsealed and fat.
Surprised, she drew from the envelope a folded
packet of bills and rapidly fingered them.</p>

<p>“Ten one-thousand-dollar bills!” she breathed.</p>

<p>Uncle George nodded. “Just so. That’s how he
sings a little love song. But he can sing a lot of
different sorts of songs, and he’s a swell performer
at a lot of other acts besides singing. That’s all,
Mary—except here’s hoping you beat him in the
end. But, though you’re clever, I’m not placing
any bets on you. Good-bye, dear.”</p>

<p>Up in her apartment Mary considered the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
of this money. Mr. Morton, she perceived, was
playing the game as he saw it; and for the present,
she decided, she must seemingly play the game in
the same way. She returned the notes into the
envelope, and slipped the packet into a drawer of
her desk.</p>

<p>She thought over her situation as a whole for a
few minutes. Her original plan involving Maisie
Jones would have been difficult enough had she been
permitted the few days on which she had counted
in which to work it out uninterrupted, but this
prompt injection of Loveman, and then of Morton,
into her scheme, doubled the number of human
objects which she must juggle without a slip. The
situation was difficult, yes,—it would require the
sharpest alertness of all her wits,—but she could
do it!</p>

<p>Mary composed herself and went in again to see
Maisie Jones, on whom she had promised to call
after she had lunched. While they chatted Mary
studied the girl with new intentness, dropping in
adroit questions which would bring out revealing
remarks. Instinctively she despised this daughter of
plutocracy: a fluffy blonde, who had had every good
thing in life served to her, unasked for, upon a
golden platter, who had never once had to think
for herself. She deserved just what was being
planned for her! But despite Mary’s scorn—which
was, perhaps, composed in part of that hate which
human nature feels toward its contemplated victim—Mary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
perceived that beneath the girl’s fluffy
worldliness, she was fundamentally the sort of girl
who develops into a woman whose life is centered
upon her domestic affairs and domestic happiness—who
demands and subsists upon loyalty. And
Mary now knew enough of Jack to know what Jack,
with his instability of purpose and affection, would
in the years to come bring into the life of this girl.</p>

<p>Again, as in the morning, Mary one by one drew
out the other qualities that lay beneath Maisie’s
girlish charm. She was spoiled, selfish, full of temper,
vindictive—and also she was proud to the last
degree, and she seemed inflexibly a Puritan in mind
and impulses. It was upon the last two qualities, of
pride and inflexible Puritanism, that Mary’s quick
mind based her now swiftly maturing plan.</p>

<p>Presently Mary, in her rôle of a member of the
smarter New York set, brought her light, humorously
cynical talk about to some of the men she
knew—to rumors of their none too circumspect
<i>amours</i>; and then, quite casually, she mentioned
Jack Morton.</p>

<p>“You know Jack Morton?” Maisie Jones asked.</p>

<p>“I’ve met him—yes.”</p>

<p>There was a quick flash of jealousy in the blue
eyes. “I happen to know him, too,—a little. Is
he—is he like those other men you spoke of?”</p>

<p>“You mean in regard to women?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Mary appeared not to be aware that this topic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
had a personal interest for Maisie Jones. Also she
had swiftly calculated how she must handle this
particular business. If she told Maisie outright some
scandal concerning Jack, Maisie in her pride might
refuse to believe her, and the matter would end right
there. Maisie had to be so led that she believed
herself to be leading, and whatever she learned she
must apparently find out for herself.</p>

<p>“Miss Jones, these men are all alike,” Mary answered
lightly, “and they say Jack Morton is the
most alike of them all.”</p>

<p>“But—but I’d heard that Jack Morton was
very steady just now.”</p>

<p>“That’s the little way men have.” Mary gave
the soft, cynical laugh of the wise young woman of
fashion. “The more that men have to hide, the
more steady and proper do they try to appear.”</p>

<p>“You mean that he is—that there is a woman—”
Maisie Jones could get no further.</p>

<p>“So they say. And I’m told he’s the same as engaged
to a nice girl in Chicago—poor thing!”</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. Mary discreetly avoided
looking in Maisie’s direction.</p>

<p>“Are you—are you certain about that other
woman?” asked a strained voice.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen him about with her several afternoons.”</p>

<p>“Afternoons? I thought he was busy till five
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“That’s a man’s oldest pretense, being busy all
day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Again a brief silence; then again the strained
voice, trying to be steady and indifferent:</p>

<p>“What is she like?”</p>

<p>“I tell you what,” said Mary casually, “if you
really want to know, I think I can show her to you—with
him. I’ve noticed them having tea together
at the Biltmore several times recently. If you like
we can go there for tea this afternoon—it will do
us both good to get out—and in the big crowd
there at tea-time we’ll never be noticed.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Maisie.</p>

<p>“Then suppose you call for me at my apartment
at four.”</p>

<p>It was so agreed. Mary said that she might be a
few minutes late because of an errand she had to do,
but that she would leave her outer door unlatched
so that Maisie might come right in and wait for her,
and she told Maisie she need not ring, as her bell
was out of order.</p>

<p>Mary went away with a sense that her delicately
devised plan was now under full way; and she saw,
as though the event were now concluded, just how
Maisie Jones would react when she, Mary, pulled
the strings of human nature. On learning what she
believed to be the truth, Maisie’s Puritanic soul
would be so horrified that she could have nothing
more to do with Jack; and further, her pride would
not permit her ever to let the public know that she
had been neglected for another woman, or possibly
even jilted. Her pride would make her keep Jack’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
secret for her own self-protection, and make her
forestall the possible appearance of being jilted by
herself doing the jilting first.</p>

<p>All that now remained, before Mary should be
safe again—barring interference from Clifford—was
for human nature to react according to human
promptings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>THE OTHER WOMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> sat on the bed in the bedroom of her suite,
trying to moderate Jack, who had furtively stolen
up five minutes before in response to her telephone
summons. The stage was set for the last act of her
carefully planned version of the eternal triangle,—the
time for the curtain to rise was near at hand,—and
as she talked to Jack she kept her ears alert
for any sound that might come through the open
door connecting with her sitting-room. This would
denote the entrance of Maisie, and was to be the
cue for the action to begin on which she had staked
everything. To prevent any misadventure to her
plan through the automatic habit of ringing bells,
Mary had disconnected the wire.</p>

<p>She had not told Jack of the rôle that he was
to play, for she had not dared to trust him with the
knowledge that he was playing a rôle—he might
balk; so she had the added difficulty of so managing
him that he would play a part without even guessing
that he was play-acting.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand this situation any longer, Mary,”
Jack fumed. “I want to come out with it all! Think
of me having to sneak up here to see my own wife!
And think of the other angle of my damned situation—being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
fairly shoved to the brink of the altar
with another woman. I can’t stall that thing off for
more than a day or so longer. Then I’ll simply have
to come out with the truth—our being married.”</p>

<p>“Jack,” she said sharply, for there had been
dynamite in his temperish speech, “you must remember
what you just agreed upon—that even
when we’re alone you are not to refer to my being
your wife, or to our marriage. You are not to
speak of those things again until I give my consent.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mary,” he groaned.</p>

<p>“For the present we’ve got to keep up the pretense
that our relationship is what we admitted before
your father. You promise that, too?”</p>

<p>“All right—I promise. But this is certainly
hell!” And he looked his misery; for his habit of
life had accustomed Jack Morton neither to suffering
nor self-restraint. “But say, I don’t see that
you’re working out anything with Maisie Jones—at
least I’ve felt no relief.”</p>

<p>“You will if you keep your promises.”</p>

<p>She looked at the little gold clock—Jack’s gift—on
her dressing-table; the hour was exactly four.
She must now, with her utmost carefulness, steer
the dialogue without Jack’s guessing that it was
being steered.</p>

<p>“What we’re doing is for the best, Jack,—you
must trust me as to that,” she said. “But, of course,
things were a lot more comfortable when we were
at the Mordona.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“Why, our flat there was heaven!” he exclaimed.
She had him talking on the right tack now,
and he held the course enthusiastically. Her ears
reached out for other sounds than his words; and
after a minute or two she heard a slight noise in her
sitting-room—and she knew that Maisie Jones had
entered; and she knew—in fact she was visualizing
it—that Maisie had heard Jack’s voice, that
Maisie had suddenly paused and was breathlessly
listening.</p>

<p>“It was pleasant, Jack,” she said distinctly—her
mind’s eye seeing the effect on the tense figure in
the next room.</p>

<p>“I’ll never forget that little flat, sweetheart,” he
enthused. “That week we spent at the Mordona—say,
that was living!”</p>

<p>“And as Mr. and Mrs. Grayson—”</p>

<p>“I wish we were back there now, Mary!” And
he seized her hands.</p>

<p>“Perhaps when you get things straightened out—and
suspicion quieted down—”</p>

<p>“You mean about Maisie Jones?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Perhaps then we can go back to our flat
in the Mordona.”</p>

<p>“No. Not back there. The Mordona won’t be
safe for us until—you know! But this old town is
full of other nice little flats—where we’ll be quiet
and cozy and nobody’ll ever find us out. And we’ll
do it the minute you say the word!”</p>

<p>“And I’ll say the word just as soon as it is safe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
You must go, Jack, in just a minute, for I’m
expecting some one.”</p>

<p>Enough had been said; her little scene was now
complete; the listening figure in the next room could
put but one interpretation upon what she had heard.
Mary let Jack hold her hands and his ardent gaze
she returned with a seemingly equal ardor. But her
faculties were really all in the next room, witnessing
what was happening there. She visioned the girl as
standing transfixed at this evidence of Jack’s faithlessness;
and then in pain, in a fury of pride,
stealing silently away—later to say, if by any chance
she ever again spoke to Mary, that she had changed her
mind and had decided not to come that afternoon.</p>

<p>That stricken, creeping figure was what Mary
visioned; that was the way she had calculated human
nature would react. What she actually saw,
the next moment, was Maisie Jones standing in the
doorway, her hands clenched so that her white
gloves had burst at a dozen seams, her figure
trembling, her blue eyes blazing fury.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard everything!” she gasped. “Oh,
you—”</p>

<p>“Maisie!” breathed Jack, staring.</p>

<p>“Oh, you sneaks—you liars—you beasts—both
of you!”</p>

<p>“Maisie—you don’t understand—listen—”</p>

<p>“Don’t come near me!” She backed through the
door. “Don’t come near me!”</p>

<p>He followed her in consternation, Mary behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
him, until all three were in the sitting-room. “Listen,
Maisie, for God’s sake!” he cried. “You don’t
understand—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do understand!” the furious girl
flamed at him. “After what I heard, I couldn’t
help understanding! You’re simply a low, vicious,
lying beast of a man, Jack Morton,—you with
your pretense of having steadied down and become
a worker! And this woman you’ve been living with—your—your—”</p>

<p>He had seized her wrist. “Maisie,” he said, “say
what you like about me. But don’t say a word
against Mary—for Mary—”</p>

<p>“Jack, stop!” Mary cried sharply, thrusting herself
between the pair. She was dismayed by this unexpected
development of her carefully constructed
triangle—but if she could end this scene quietly the
situation might somehow be saved. “Stop, Jack!”
she added warningly. “What she says won’t hurt
me.”</p>

<p>Maisie, her control now all gone, turned her fury
and scorn full upon Mary. “You adventuress!
You common street woman! You cheap seller of
yourself! You—you—”</p>

<p>Jack gasped at her enraged words, then broke
through Mary’s intervention.</p>

<p>“You shall not say such things about Mary!” he
cried in an almost equal rage. “Mary is my wife!”</p>

<p>“Your wife!” repeated Maisie.</p>

<p>“Yes, my wife!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“Jack, be still!” cried Mary. “Miss Jones, he’s
lying to protect me. I don’t like the words you
used about me; but in substance they’re the truth.”</p>

<p>“They’re not the truth, Maisie!” Jack, for that
moment, had passed beyond Mary’s control. “She’s
my wife, and nobody can say such things about
her! She’s my wife, and I can prove it!” Swiftly he
took a wallet from an inside pocket of his vest, drew
a slip of paper from it, and thrust it into Maisie’s
hands. “There—look at that!”</p>

<p>There was neither time nor chance for Mary to
interfere. Maisie glanced at the slip of paper. Her
volcanic wrath suddenly subsided; her face blanched.
Then mechanically her lips repeated the script in
the printed form she held: “John Harrison Morton
and Mary Russell Regan.”</p>

<p>She looked up; she was in a daze. “Your marriage
certificate, Jack,” she said in her mechanical tone.
And then questioningly: “But Mary Regan?”</p>

<p>“That’s Mary’s real name—she just borrowed
the name of Mrs. Gardner,” Jack explained. “You
see we were married secretly because Mary thought
father would object to her; and also because—don’t
take this in a wrong way, Maisie—because of what
father wanted you and me to do.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the heavy lips. She turned to Mary,
“But those things I just overheard? And your
pretending not to be Jack’s wife?”</p>

<p>Mary’s plan had gone so far from its calculated
course, and so swiftly, that upon the instant she saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
no better way than to tell the truth—even if she
should not tell it all.</p>

<p>“Miss Jones, I planned for you to overhear, and
believe, what passed between Jack and me—though
Jack had no knowledge of what I was doing. I
thought that if you discovered that Jack was in love
with another woman—and had been living with
her—your insulted pride would cause you to break
with Jack and give no reason.”</p>

<p>“Yes—go on,” breathed the girl.</p>

<p>“You see, Jack was in the worst sort of a predicament.
He was married to me; he was dependent as
to his future upon his father; and his father was trying
to press him into an immediate marriage with
you. It was a matter of days. Had he told the truth
or had he for no explained reason broken with you—either
would have ended him with his father. There
was only one way out of the situation that would
not ruin Jack, and that was for you to be the one to
break it off. To play upon you so that you would do
that, that’s what I’ve been trying to do.”</p>

<p>“I see.” The girl, grayish pale, regarded Mary
in dazed wonderment. “But why did you, just a
moment ago, try to make me believe that you were
Jack’s—his—his mistress?”</p>

<p>“To keep Jack’s father from learning the truth.
Don’t you see it? If you should tell his father
that you had learned that Jack had a mistress, it
would not injure Jack’s prospects nearly so much as
if you told him that Jack had a wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“And, Maisie,” Jack cut in, “if I have steadied
down, it’s because Mary made me! I want you to
know that!”</p>

<p>The blue-eyed girl, standing very still, and breathing
very tensely, made no response, but kept her
gaze fastened upon Mary. Mary tried to guess what
was passing in the mind of this girl—young, willful,
of proven jealousy and temper, who, holding
that marriage certificate in her hand, held also
Mary’s fate. What was that girl going to do?</p>

<p>A minute or more passed, all three of them motionless
and silent—a space Mary was never to
forget. Then the tableau was sharply broken by a
soft knocking at the door of the suite. The three
turned about, just as the unlatched door swung
cautiously open and into the room stepped the elder
Morton, his masterful face bouqueted with a smile.
He stopped short and the smile was plucked away.</p>

<p>No one of the four moved or spoke; then followed
tense silence which, though but a moment long,
seemed an epoch to three of the group—each of
whom sensed a different charge of human dynamite,
its fuse sputtering, in this scene.... The elder Morton,
here on such other business, looked penetratingly
at the unexpected trio: did the presence of the
three mean that Maisie had learned the truth about
Jack and Mrs. Gardner?—which would disrupt one
of his dearest and most patient plans. And also did
they suspect why he was here?... As for Jack, he
was merely stricken dumb and powerless with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
sense of unavertable disaster—the axe was already
falling.... And Mary, her will nullified for the
moment by a sense of futility, breathlessly watched
the grayish face of Maisie Jones, who, in the hand
that now held the crumpled marriage certificate, also
held the swift <i>finale</i> to all her planning; each second
she expected the outraged, jealous, and vindictive
girl to speak, or hand the crumpled paper to the
gray-templed man beside the door.</p>

<p>It was the elder Morton, trained by his worldly
experience to keep on playing his part whatever the
circumstances, who ended this hour-long moment.</p>

<p>“I just started to call on you, Maisie,” he explained
evenly, pleasantly, “and at your door I
learned from a maid that you were with Mrs. Gardner.
I pressed the bell-button, then knocked, but
as there was no answer, and as the door was open,
I ventured in—and here I find the three of you.”</p>

<p>Mary felt the uselessness of further effort, since
the other girl held her fate in her tightly clenched
hand; but her inborn quality of keeping on mechanically
forced words from her lips—though as
she spoke them she recognized her words as a lame
explanation. “Miss Jones was going out with your
son, and as she was passing she stopped in for a
moment.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton looked keenly at Maisie, and waited;
and Mary looked at her, in suspense yet sure of the
end, and waited.</p>

<p>Then the gray-faced girl spoke for the first time—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
her fingers twitched about the document she
held.</p>

<p>“Yes, Jack and I were passing, and just dropped
in.”</p>

<p>Mary maintained her outward composure, but
inwardly she started. So!—Maisie Jones was holding
back her weapon, waiting her chosen time to
strike.</p>

<p>Morton seemed to accept Maisie’s words; but
before another word could be spoken, while all the
dangerous human elements of the situation were in
suspense, Mary saw a new figure press open the
unlatched door—Peter Loveman. In a flash she
understood the little lawyer’s presence: that dread
which had caused him to be forever hovering about
her and Mr. Morton had made him follow Morton
here—that he might be beforehand and save
himself, in case of mishap to her impossible plans.</p>

<p>Her mind, working with incredible speed, had
another instantaneous fear. Every instant she expected
Clifford to enter and add to the complications
swarming upon her.</p>

<p>Loveman’s round, keen eyes swiftly took in the
situation. To him this coming together of the four
of them face to face, of Mr. Morton, Jack, Mary,
and the girl Jack had been directed to marry, could
have but one meaning, one outcome. His speech
followed his conclusion so promptly that there was
barely a moment between his entrance and his first
word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Pardon my coming up here, Mr. Morton,” he
said rapidly, stepping forward, “but the matter is so
immensely important as to abrogate formalities. I
have just made a discovery—”</p>

<p>“Mr. Morton,” Mary interrupted sharply, pressing
between the two men. She knew that yet a
new destruction was in Loveman’s next eager words;
and her instinct to keep on fighting to the very end
instantly controlled her. “Mr. Morton—before you
hear him, read my letter!”</p>

<p>“Your letter?” queried Mr. Morton, taken aback
by the suddenness of all this.</p>

<p>“The letter I gave you in the Japanese Room. The
letter I told you to hold until I gave you permission
to read it. You have it with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, here it is, Mrs. Gardner.” He drew an envelope
from an inner coat pocket.</p>

<p>“Mr. Morton, I’ve just discovered—”</p>

<p>“Read my letter first,” Mary again broke sharply
in upon Loveman. “The time has come that I spoke
of, Mr. Morton,—the time when you have my permission
to read my letter. It tells you all that Mr.
Loveman has discovered and more!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Morton—”</p>

<p>“You wait, Loveman. Mrs. Gardner first.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton ran a forefinger beneath the embossed
flap. The little lawyer was yellowish-pale,
there was a spasmodic quivering of the soft folds
beneath which his Adam’s apple was throbbing.
Mary saw Loveman’s condition, and with a seemingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
involuntary action, laid a hand upon the finger
of Mr. Morton’s that was sheathed in the envelope.</p>

<p>“That letter contains everything, Mr. Morton.
I wasn’t quite ready for you to know it. I’d rather
you did not know it yet—but Mr. Loveman has
forced me.” She turned to Loveman, and her next
words had in them a hidden meaning for him, and
another meaning for Mr. Morton. “Since you are
determined, Mr. Loveman, that Mr. Morton must
know it, I prefer that he learn it from me—and
that he learn everything.”</p>

<p>In her steady glance, the sallow little man read
reckless defiance—and beneath her words he read
the offer of a bargain. And he had a swift sense,
vague as yet, that the situation might not be as
desperate as he had at first believed.</p>

<p>“If Mrs. Gardner really prefers that nothing be
said about it just now—”</p>

<p>“I do prefer,” she interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Why, then, naturally, I’ll not say anything at
present—provided Mrs. Gardner agrees to say
nothing.”</p>

<p>“I agree.”</p>

<p>“And the letter?” softly suggested Loveman.</p>

<p>“With your permission, Mr. Morton,” and Mary
deftly slipped the envelope out of his hands.</p>

<p>“But, see here, the letter was mine!” Morton exclaimed.
“Where do I come in?”</p>

<p>“It is my confession, is it not?—and hasn’t a
woman the right to choose the time when she makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
it? You shall know everything—when the right
time comes.”</p>

<p>She turned to the little lawyer. “I believe that is
all, Mr. Loveman.”</p>

<p>“But the letter?” he prompted.</p>

<p>She understood. “You definitely promise?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then”—and slowly, all eyes upon
her, Mary tore the sealed letter up and dropped the
pieces into the waste-basket.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause. Each of the four had
his own belief as to the revelation in that letter she
had so calmly torn to fragments. As for Mary, she
was outwardly composed enough; she believed that
the crisis with Loveman was safely passed—perhaps;
but every second she was poignantly aware
of the danger represented by that motionless girl
who still held the marriage certificate in her hand.
Mary could not guess what that emotional, jealous,
pampered girl would do, nor at what instant she
would do it.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton turned from Mary to Jack and
Maisie. “Run along, children,” he said pleasantly,
“and do whatever it was you were planning to do.
I may pick you up later somewhere.”</p>

<p>Almost mechanically the girl walked out. With a
quick glance of fear at Mary, Jack went after her—and
Mary followed her with her eyes, wondering.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>HOW MAISIE JONES REACTED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton</span> turned upon Mary the instant Jack
and Maisie Jones were out.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Gardner, how much did Miss Jones learn or
guess about you and Jack?” he demanded sharply.</p>

<p>“You saw the scene, you can draw your own conclusions,”
replied Mary. “If you wish to know definitely,
I suggest you ask Miss Jones.”</p>

<p>“U’m. She didn’t seem to know just what to
make of the scene—but I don’t believe she suspected
anything. You carried it all off mighty well,—Mrs.
Gardner,—mighty well; in fact you saved
the situation. Loveman”—with sharp rebuke—“you
damned near spilled everything, trying to
blurt out your discovery before Miss Jones!”</p>

<p>“That’s once I didn’t stop to think,” apologized
Loveman.</p>

<p>“Then suppose you excuse yourself and do some
thinking outside. I want a few words with Miss
Gilmore—beg pardon, Mrs. Gardner I should say.”</p>

<p>“But—first I’d like a few words with Mr. Loveman,”
said Mary,—“alone.”</p>

<p>She stepped out into the corridor ahead of Loveman,
walked a few unsteady paces, and turned a
corner. This corridor was empty. She halted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“What did you want to see me about, Mary?”
the little lawyer asked nervously.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to see you—I wanted to get out
of that room—after what I’ve been through.”</p>

<p>She leaned dizzily against the wall, and breathed
like a runner at the end of a race. The situation she
had just been through had, indeed, taxed her full
strength; but her mind went on to dangers yet
ahead. That girl with the marriage certificate in her
hand—she had held back because she was waiting
a better time, and a more effective method, to strike.
And when she struck, she would strike hard—no
doubt of that! Mary wondered in what form of cold
fury the girl’s natural feminine vindictiveness would
express itself.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes. Peter Loveman was still
waiting beside her.</p>

<p>“I guess I didn’t quite get the situation when I
broke in on that scene awhile ago,” the little man
began apologetically. “I thought it was all up with
you—and I thought I might as well save myself
if I could.”</p>

<p>“I know,” she said wearily. And then vigor came
into her voice and bearing. “But don’t forget this,
Peter Loveman,—if you ever try to cross me again,
I’ll finish you off with Mr. Morton just as I said—even
though I finish myself, too!”</p>

<p>“That’s never going to happen, Mary,” the little
man said propitiatingly. “And remember, Mary,
what I said to you this morning—that if this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
affair gives any sign of going wrong, just privately
leave your end of it with me—and after that let
me manage you—and there’s nothing I can’t do with
you! Nothing!”</p>

<p>She regarded him absently—although the vision
his words had created registered itself in her subconscious
mind as something that might come to
pass in the future. Without answering him, she
turned away and reëntered her apartment. Beside
her door she came to a sudden pause. Bending over
her desk was Mr. Morton intently working over
something which she could not identify. But the
next moment she knew. Mr. Morton had recovered
from the waste-basket her torn letter and was fitting
its fragments together.</p>

<p>Instantly she was across the room, and had caught
his arm. “Mr. Morton, you mustn’t do that!” she
exclaimed, reaching swiftly for the letter.</p>

<p>He easily warded off her clutching hand. She
struggled to possess the fragments. But he was too
powerful a man for her to contest with on equal
physical terms, and she dared not cry out—so after
a moment she gave up.</p>

<p>“Really, Miss Gilmore, you know, you can’t trust
a man’s curiosity too far,” he said coolly, though
pleasantly; and holding her two wrists in a powerful,
yet gentle grip, he read the torn letter through.</p>

<p>He looked up. His face was without expression.</p>

<p>“And so, Miss Gilmore—<i>this</i> is your confession?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“And also your answer to my suggestion about
our little cruise?”</p>

<p>Again she nodded.</p>

<p>“So!” He turned back to the ragged mosaic of
heavy note-paper, and slowly he read aloud:—</p>

<p>“‘I can no longer keep my secret from you. I am
really a married woman. Further, my husband is
very jealous. He may be back any time. I must be
most discreet.’”</p>

<p>Morton raised his gray eyes to her; and then suddenly
his strong, worldly face softened into a smile.</p>

<p>“My dear, what a little fool you are! This is
nothing to make such a fuss about. Your being
married doesn’t necessarily make the slightest difference
to me—and I’m sure the Caribbean winds
will be just as soothing—and that the moonlight
will be just as soft. The yacht will be ready next
Thursday.”</p>

<p>He tried to slip an arm about her. But she evaded
him, and spoke quietly.</p>

<p>“But my husband is now in New York!”</p>

<p>“Oh, the devil!” And then he smiled again. “But
I’m sure a woman of your quickness of mind can
invent an excuse that will take care of your husband.
You can trust that my end will all be managed
quietly.”</p>

<p>Again she avoided an attempted embrace. “But
he is now in this hotel—and he knows I’m here—and
he’s so jealous—”</p>

<p>“The devil!” This time he did not smile. “That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
is some complication! You certainly do have to be
discreet!” He thought quickly. “You’d better
move from this hotel to some place where you will
not be so easily under his eye. Anyhow, I was going
to suggest your moving on account of Miss Jones.
Being this close to her, she might any time stumble
on to—you know, between you and Jack.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to move to-night,” she agreed, her
mind all on how she was going to rid herself of him,
and yet not offend him.</p>

<p>“Good! Now, as token and seal of our understanding—”
He bent toward her with pursed lips.</p>

<p>She checked him with the thrust of a stiffened
arm. “Not now!”</p>

<p>“Some day, then? And soon?”</p>

<p>She eyed him steadily. “Sometime, perhaps—if
when that time comes you still want to.”</p>

<p>He had no suspicion of what was in her mind. He
smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall want to! But don’t set the time too
far—”</p>

<p>The telephone on her desk began to ring. In relief
at the interruption she seized it—but the relief
was gone as she heard the voice that came over the
wire.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m alone,” she replied into the mouthpiece.
“You may see me right away.”</p>

<p>“Who was that?” asked Morton as she hung up.</p>

<p>“My husband.”</p>

<p>“My cue for a quick exit! Remember, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
dear”—he seized both her hands—“we’re going
to have that little cruise just the same. I’ll give
orders—”</p>

<p>“You must hurry,” she interrupted. While he
had been speaking, she had reached quickly behind
her back, opened a little drawer and thrust
into it her hand. “You must hurry,” she repeated,
and urgently pressed her hands against him—and
while doing so she slipped the envelope containing
the ten one-thousand-dollar bills into the inner
pocket of his coat. “Go, please! Good-bye!”</p>

<p>The next instant he was gone. Mary sank into
a chair beside her window. She had won thus far
through her wit and her will; but wit and will would
serve her no further; she was spent—utterly spent.
What was her culminating scene, the scene that
would end her, lay just before her, and for it she had
neither strength nor subterfuge nor courage. She
had fought, through sheer force of habit, to the
end—and at the end, which was only a moment
ahead, she had lost. So she leaned back in her chair,
limp, her eyes closed....</p>

<p>But spent as she was she was sufficiently alive
for her curiosity to respond to a matter that again
recurred to her. Clifford had known of her whereabouts,
possibly of her purpose. Why had he not
interfered?... Why?...</p>

<p>A minute or two passed; then she became aware
that some one had entered and had crossed to her
side. She slowly opened her eyes, and wearily arose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
and regarded Maisie Jones dully, indifferent to denunciation
or threats or furious acts.</p>

<p>“You telephoned you wished to see me,” she said.</p>

<p>Maisie, very rigid and still gray of face, did not
at once speak.</p>

<p>“Well?” prompted Mary.</p>

<p>“I came to tell you what I intend to do,” said
the other, and stopped.</p>

<p>“Go on. I know just about how you feel, and I
guess I’d do about the same. I’m prepared, so don’t
try to break it easy to me.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the girl,—and there was a
catch in her voice,—“of course you know that I
love Jack.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“I love him so well,” continued the girl, “that I
don’t want to do anything to hurt him.” She swallowed,
then drove herself on, her blue eyes gazing
straight into Mary’s dark ones. “I’m going to be
honest. I’m not doing this because it’s easy; nor
because I like you—I can’t do that yet. I’m doing
it for—for Jack.”</p>

<p>“Doing what?” breathed Mary, suddenly bewildered.</p>

<p>“I’m doing it because I see you can be more to
Jack than I can ever be,” the girl went on. “You’re
the sort of woman that can make a man—you
proved that when you made Jack steady down and
go to work. I could never have done that for Jack.”</p>

<p>Mary could only stare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“And I think it was big of you,” the voice went
on, now a choked and awed voice, “to try to save
Jack by sacrificing yourself—by being willing to
acknowledge yourself his—his mistress, and accept
that humiliation, in order to protect him. I could
never have done that either.”</p>

<p>Still Mary, sure manager of her destiny, could not
speak—could only stare at the white face which
had begun to work.</p>

<p>“I shall return to Chicago to-night,” the girl went
on. “In a week or two I shall make my aunt write
Jack’s father, giving no reason, stating I no longer
care for Jack and wish everything broken off. And
I shall write, confirming this. That will put me out
of the way—I’ll no longer be a source of danger to
you and Jack. I guess that’s all. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>She thrust the marriage certificate into Mary’s
hands and turned and started rapidly out. Then she
abruptly turned and came back; and she gripped
Mary’s hands, and her blue eyes were flooding.</p>

<p>“I can’t like you—yet. But I’m not going to
let myself be mean about this,” she said huskily, in
awe and humility. “I wish I were as fine as you
are! You are wonderful—wonderful!”</p>

<p>Suddenly she leaned forward and kissed Mary’s
cheek; and then, this time, she was gone.</p>

<p>Mary gazed after her with wide eyes, then sank
limply into a chair. She had won—for the time
being; but that she had won did not at this moment
even touch her thoughts; nor just then was her mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
trying to justify her by saying that Maisie, as now
she saw her, was too good for Jack, and that her own
action, whatever its motives, had saved Maisie from
a life of certain unhappiness. Just then she was
dazed by the uncalculated twist of the girl’s action;
unsuspected, unanalyzable things were tumultuously
stirring, quickened into life by that swift, tear-wet
kiss which still thrilled her cheek—by the fervid
declaration that she was fine and wonderful.
That girl, tears in her eyes, had called her fine and
wonderful!...</p>

<p>She seemed, with all those sudden strange things
surging within her, to be sitting there a woman unknown
to herself. And then out of this chaos, there
rose a clear-cut, definite sentence, that remained
fixed before her mind—a sentence of Clifford’s,
spoken with impersonal grimness: “There is a big
woman in you—but if you are to be changed, only
Life can do it.”... Was this what it meant, that
chaos within her? After all, had Clifford been right?
Was Life doing something to her?</p>

<p>Bewildered, breathless, almost fearfully, she sat
regarding this strange, unknown woman stirring
within herself....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>MARY THINKS THINGS OUT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> awoke with a start to certain practical and
immediate dangers of her situation. Mr. Morton
knew she was here at the Grantham, and so did
Peter Loveman; whatever she might do in the end,
she had a desire to avoid both of these men for the
present—at least until she had determined upon
her course. There was but one way to escape them,
and that was to disappear from the Grantham before
either of the pair had time to return upon their different
enterprises.</p>

<p>Within an hour she and her baggage were at another
hotel. Within a second hour she was being
shown about by a representative of a renting agency.
That same evening she was installed in a little furnished
apartment in the Nineties just west of Central
Park. The better to protect her privacy she
decided she would do her own housework and would
go out rarely except in the evening.</p>

<p>Here her mind began once more to review her situation—as
it was to keep on doing for many a long
day to come. She had won, by an unbelievable twist
of human nature. Yet she had not won; she was,
as she now perceived, only at the beginning of an
enterprise that was hourly becoming more complex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
and difficult—and that was also leading into what
for her were undiscovered and uncomfortable areas
of the human soul.</p>

<p>To be sure, for the immediate present at least, she
had apparently averted the danger of the discovery
of her secret marriage to Jack Morton. But the danger
of that discovery would keep on recurring—at
least until she had finally won out. And there was
the ever-present danger that her husband, and her
husband’s father, might somehow learn who Mary
Regan was and had been. And there was the elder
Morton, eager in his amorous suit. And there was
Peter Loveman, who might any time, to serve his
own ends, proceed swiftly upon some course that
would mean disaster for her.</p>

<p>And then, there were those queer feelings which
had been stirring in her since Maisie Jones, a choke
in her voice, had called her fine!—wonderful!—and
since Maisie, loving Jack, had declared Mary
had proved that she would make far the better wife
for Jack. Mary did not understand these strange
emotions. She did not like them, and she tried to
force them out of her being. But despite this
effort there were fear-stricken moments when, with
all her dangers, she felt that she could not even count
upon herself.</p>

<p>The next morning she called up Jack, telling him
where she was. He could telephone her as often as
he liked, she told him, if he would be careful to
speak only when he was alone. But she forbade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
him coming to see her; that would be unsafe, as
he might be followed. Jack protested against this
order, but she was firm, and at length he gave his
promise.</p>

<p>As the days passed, days when she had no company
except her own thoughts and Jack’s telephone
messages, she reasoned herself out of the influence
of those strange feelings begotten by the behavior
and the words of Maisie Jones (at least she believed
she did), and she reached a clearer conception of
herself (or believed she did) and of what must be her
future procedure. And the way she saw herself, her
plans, her motives, was anything but unfavorable.
She was just like most other women. She wanted
position, yes—she wanted money, yes; and she was
getting them in exactly the same way that the most
proper and honored women were winning them, by
playing her cards as a woman. As for what she was
hiding—well, wasn’t all the world hiding something?
She was merely doing what all were doing.</p>

<p>She came to see herself—despite the methods by
which she would attain her end—as making a
figure as a wife that Jack would be proud of before
the world. As Jack’s wife she was going to give him
her best. No man’s wife was going to be better-gowned
or of more distinguished appearance, and
no wife could do more than she, with the will and
the brains which she knew she had, to hold her husband
up to the standards expected of a man of large
affairs. Later, after she had made Jack into a real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
man, and through that service had somehow managed
to get Jack’s father reconciled, and after she
had thoroughly established herself with them and
as a noteworthy figure in their circle—later she
would tell them just who she was and what she had
been, and by that time Mr. Morton would recognize
that she was the one woman in the world who
could have brought, and could still hold, Jack to
such a position of worldly success.</p>

<p>Thus she thought, as the lonely days went by. But
as more and more she saw Jack as the foundation
of her plan, so more and more did she see him in another
possible aspect. This second possibility grew
to be her chief concern.</p>

<p>All this while her mind had been reverting again
and again to Clifford. After a time Clifford and her
dominating concern began to be linked together.
At length there came a day when, obeying an impulse,
she called Clifford up.</p>

<p>Within an hour she was opening her door to him.
Silently she led the way across the dingy, chintz-furnished
sitting-room, and with a rather stiff formality
the pair seated themselves.</p>

<p>“You sent for me,” Clifford began, quietly
enough.</p>

<p>“Yes. I want you to help me.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind explaining?”</p>

<p>Already she had taken on that cool, defiant, challenging
manner which seemed instinctive with her
in all her dealings with him. “You helped get me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
into my marriage with Jack Morton. You said that
experience was the only thing which could make me
over—and that this marriage might prove to be
the best possible experience by which Life could
change me. Remember that?”</p>

<p>“I did say something to that effect,” he replied
quietly, watching her and still wondering.</p>

<p>“Well, I am not going to be changed; I have
told you that. But I have accepted your challenge,
and I’ll play the thing through to the finish. But
you are partly responsible for my position. That’s
why I have the right to ask you to help me.”</p>

<p>He stared. Only one so essentially defiant in
spirit, so audaciously self-confident, could be
saying such things so quietly.</p>

<p>“You want me to lose out,” she went on, “but
even so, I know you’ll help me if you promise to do
so. I’ll admit that there is no other person I can
call on who can really help me.”</p>

<p>“Help you? How?”</p>

<p>“With Jack.”</p>

<p>He was accustomed to her calm audacity. But
none the less he was for the moment taken aback
by her request—that he, a rejected suitor, should
be so coolly called in to assist with the husband.</p>

<p>He recovered his speech. “Before I answer that,
perhaps you will tell me something.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Something that has a bearing upon your plan
with Jack. Excuse my curiosity—but perhaps you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
will tell me just what was the outcome of your affair
with Maisie Jones?”</p>

<p>She was no less curious than he in regard to one
point in that experience—why he had refrained
from action at the Grantham. She had been wondering
about this, over and over, all these days.</p>

<p>“You know about that?” Her words were as
much an affirmation as a question.</p>

<p>“I have had to know about it,” he said. “I knew
of Jack’s engagement and its pressing character, and
when you went to the Grantham and took the suite
next to Miss Jones, I surmised, with the help of a
few facts, the general nature of your purpose there.”</p>

<p>“Then if you knew, why didn’t you interfere?”</p>

<p>“When I surmised what your plan was, I felt it
was no affair of mine. I was close at hand, but I
kept myself in the background. I felt that it was
your game, for you to play out alone.”</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath. So that was his reason!—he
had given her her leash, he was letting her run
free. Though watching her, he was, as he had said
before, leaving it to experience to make of her what
it would.</p>

<p>She recalled his initial inquiry. “The affair
ended,” she said briefly, “by my being forced to
tell Maisie Jones, in confidence, that I was secretly
married to Jack.”</p>

<p>“And Maisie Jones? I know she loved Jack.”</p>

<p>“She promised not to tell, or interfere.”</p>

<p>“Is that all? And if so, why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“She seemed to think—I did not try to deceive
her; she deceived herself—she seemed to think I
would make Jack a better wife than she would. And
she said that, so Jack wouldn’t get into trouble
with his father about the engagement, she would
have a letter written to Mr. Morton breaking the
engagement off because she did not love Jack.”</p>

<p>“Is that all?”</p>

<p>She met his gaze with composure, showing nothing
of the strange and persisting emotion Maisie Jones
had awakened in her. “That is all.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.” He did not pursue his inquiry,
though his eyes regarded her keenly. “To come
back to your request that I help you with Jack.
Whether I help you depends upon what you intend
doing. First, how do you happen to be here?”</p>

<p>Her answer was prompt and direct. “After all that
has happened, it seemed safest and wisest for me to
disappear. Too many persons were becoming mixed
up in my affairs—I wanted to be free from them.”</p>

<p>“How about Jack? Is he also in the dark as to
where you are?”</p>

<p>“Jack knows. But I do not dare see him.”</p>

<p>“And these are the only reasons you disappeared
so suddenly from the Grantham?”</p>

<p>“The only reasons,” she returned steadily. But
consciously or unconsciously Mary here withheld
part of the truth. There was something else: the
unadmitted influence which the action of Maisie
Jones had had upon her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“Next, if I am to help you,” continued Clifford,
“what are your general plans for the future? You
don’t mind telling?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind telling you everything.” And she
went on to tell him these things which she had
thought out more definitely during her solitary
days. “My general plans are what they have been
since I married. My main purpose at present is
to keep Jack going straight—until through my
influence he shall have become established as a
responsible business man; this I expect to be an
achievement for which I shall secure acknowledgment
and which will win Mr. Morton’s favor. And
then, a little later, after I have established myself
with them, and have been openly before the public
as Jack’s wife, I shall tell them just who I am and
what I have done.”</p>

<p>“And having done that, what do you think will
happen?”</p>

<p>“I shall have proved to them that I am the one
person who can hold Jack to the job of being a man;
and I shall have proved to them that, despite my
being Mary Regan, I can make a figure as a woman
that Jack and his father will be proud of before the
world. That is my plan.”</p>

<p>The calculating worldliness of her frank scheme
was amazing. Here was the strangest part of their
recent relationship—she had made it a point always
to show him her most worldly side.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Clifford. “But there are a few difficulties.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
How about the older Morton and his urgent
invitation to a cruise for two passengers among the
West Indies?”</p>

<p>“So long as I can keep in hiding, that’s not a
pressing problem. And if somehow he learns where
I am, I shall be evasive; I can manage that.”</p>

<p>“And Peter Loveman, if he finds you are here?”</p>

<p>“I can handle Peter Loveman,” she replied
confidently; and then added: “Not long ago he wanted
me to give up my plan concerning Jack. In fact he
threatened me.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Clifford asked quickly.</p>

<p>“He said I could not possibly succeed. Also there
was something else he wanted me to do.”</p>

<p>“And you replied to him?”</p>

<p>“I told him I was going straight ahead. And I
showed him that I was stronger than he was. He
then suddenly became pleasant again, said his threat
had been only a joke. If I called the turn on him
once, I guess I can call it again if necessary.”</p>

<p>Clifford made mental note of this threat. “Let’s
come back to Jack. Would you mind being more
explicit why, and in what way, you want me to
help?”</p>

<p>“All my chances of success are based upon making
a man of Jack. As matters now stand, it would
ruin everything if I were to see him often. Jack is
very susceptible to the influence of the people
immediately around him—and if I dare not see him, how
can I influence him? That is my supreme difficulty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“I see,” said Clifford.</p>

<p>“Just there is where I want you to help me. Jack
likes you. I want you to see a lot of him—help
keep him working—help keep him straight.”</p>

<p>Clifford stared at her. Her calm audacity was
almost unbelievable—and yet it was just like Mary
Regan.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you,” he said after a moment. “Is there
any special source of danger you fear?”</p>

<p>“Only the general situation. Everything depends
on Jack’s being a man. Just now I can’t help him
much; and Jack—you understand—is likely to go
in the direction of the person who is nearest him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do what I can,” said Clifford.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time since his entrance, she
showed emotion. Impulsively she thrust out her
hand and clasped his.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” she said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>CLIFFORD’S NEW ASSIGNMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Clifford left her, though still amazed at the
task she had set him, he was more occupied with a
new possibility—Life worked so strangely!—that
had come upon him during their talk. Had Mary,
through her scheming to achieve worldly place and
fortune by means of Jack, come by slow degrees and
perhaps unknown to herself to have a real
responsibility toward Jack? And if so, how would she
react under that responsibility if ever a crisis
should arise?</p>

<p>At once Clifford began work upon this strange
assignment. And at once this assignment, strange
as it was to start with, took on an even stranger
twist—though this new turn was not at once
definitely apparent.</p>

<p>Clifford was curious concerning Jack in his new
rôle as a business man; and half an hour after leaving
Mary he was shown into an office in a large suite
down in the financial district. Jack sprung up eagerly
from a littered desk.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bob! Say, this is great, your dropping
in on me like this—a regular relief expedition to
a strayed North-Pole-hunting outfit! Only, as a
financier, I’m no Commodore Peary; I’m in the
Dr. Cook class.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>Clifford returned the smile of the pleasant, almost
boyish face. “How goes the work, Jack?”</p>

<p>The young fellow made a grimace at the papers on
his desk. “They’ve turned over a one-cylinder mining
proposition to me to handle. Oh, ye gods!
Bob—has science yet discovered an anti-toxin for
work?”</p>

<p>“Then you’re getting tired of it?” Clifford asked,
studying him keenly.</p>

<p>“Tired, you bet!—and also tangled. But I’m
going to stick it out.” He lowered his voice: “You
know, it’s all Mary’s doing, my starting to toil in
this old foundry. She said I had to make good—and
you can just bet I am going to make good!”</p>

<p>Clifford nodded. “It’s great stuff; hang on with
all your teeth. But you can’t be on the job all the
time. Suppose we have dinner together this evening
and then see a show?”</p>

<p>“Sorry, Bob, but I’m dated up with dad to-night.
If you’ll make it to-morrow evening, though,
you’re on.”</p>

<p>“All right. Say we meet at seven in the Gold
Room at the Grantham.”</p>

<p>It was so agreed. Clifford left Jack with one
dominant impression: at least this phase of Mary’s
scheme was visibly succeeding—Jack, whom no
one had ever been able to get to go to work before,
seemed tightly anchored to his job.</p>

<p>The next evening Clifford was at a table in the
Grantham at seven. He waited until eight—untroubled—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
Jack did not appear and no message
came from him. It puzzled him somewhat, but provoked
him more. But, remembering his promise
to Mary, he swallowed his resentment and the next
afternoon he called Jack up at the Morton offices.
He was informed that Jack had not come down at
all the day previous, nor had he appeared this
day.</p>

<p>Clifford began to think. That same afternoon, at
six-thirty, which he had learned was the elder Morton’s
cocktail-time, he wandered into the lounge of
the Biltmore bar. Here he found Mr. Morton, and
casually he inquired for Jack.</p>

<p>“I was afraid the boy wouldn’t stick,” said the
handsome, middle-aged man of the world, “and
now I’ve had proof of it. Here’s a telegram I received
from him this afternoon, filed on board the
Canadian Express, saying he’d suddenly decided
to run away for a bit of shooting. Just like him, to
disappear without a word’s notice.”</p>

<p>Clifford read the telegram, and returned it to the
Western financier; and after a few commonplace remarks
he walked away with a casual air. But within
his calm exterior he was seething with suspicions,
ideas, questions. He dropped into a chair in the
wide corridor, and eyes fixed on an evening paper, he
rapidly studied this new situation. That telegram
was a fake. Jack Morton, however irresponsible,
would never so behave while he felt as he did toward
Mary Regan. Jack Morton had disappeared, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
some will other than his own had controlled his
disappearance.</p>

<p>Who had brought about this disappearance? If
there was a plot here, just what was the plot?—and
what its purpose? Was Jack himself the victim
primarily aimed at?—his father?—Mary?—some
other person?</p>

<p>Into his mind there flashed something Mary had
spoken of: that menacing demand of Peter Loveman,
coupled with Loveman’s jovial declaration that
his threat had been only a joke. Was that shrewd,
far-scheming lawyer behind the disappearance of
Jack? And if so, what was his ultimate object?—what
was his present plan?</p>

<p>A new idea occurred to Clifford. A minute later
he was in a telephone booth talking to Mary.</p>

<p>“What have you heard from Jack since I saw
you?”</p>

<p>“Not a word.” There was concern in her voice.
“He always telephones me two or three times a day.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve had no telegram?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to worry about,”—and Clifford
told her of the telegram Jack’s father had received.</p>

<p>“But why shouldn’t he have telegraphed me,
too?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“You know Jack is inclined to be careless, even
with the people he likes best,” he assured her. He
gave her no hint of his suspicions; already it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
part of his vaguely forming counter-plan that Mary
must be kept from guessing what he suspected.</p>

<p>He hung up and returned to his chair. He had
picked up one point—perhaps. The fact that Mary
had received no telegram, did it not signify that the
person behind the scheme, whoever the person was,
while wishing to reassure Mr. Morton, desired to
disturb Mary? Might it not be an essential part of the
scheme that Mary should be disturbed? It seemed
possible.</p>

<p>Sitting there in the corridor, Clifford had still
another idea—and during the days that followed
it became the backbone of his plan. Here was mystery
enough: the sudden disappearance of Jack in a
manner so in keeping with his known character as
to cause no public commotion. But he now saw this
case as a double case. He was going to try to clear
up Jack’s disappearance, yes; but though professionally
the solution of that disappearance was his
chief interest, as a man he was more interested in
Mary Regan—for though he knew her so well, she
was to him still the supreme mystery. He was going
to do all he could do, yes; but he decided that he
was going to keep himself in the background of this
new development of affairs, and direct the action,
or leave it to its own direction, so that whatever
situation arose, Mary would have to face it squarely
and alone. He was going to force a show-down of
Mary’s real nature—to make Life test her. That
was his second, and dominant, task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>The search for Jack Morton was the foundation
for this second task, and Clifford sensed Loveman
to be his best lead. That night, with all the appearance
of merely killing time, Clifford sat at a little
table in the Gold Room at the Grantham. But while
he dawdled, he slipped an occasional glance across
the big glittering room at the small round table
known as “Mr. Loveman’s table.” The table was
as yet empty: Clifford did not wonder at this—the
hour was only eleven, this was the opening of a new
play, and Loveman was an habitual first-nighter.</p>

<p>Presently a hand fell on Clifford’s shoulder.
“Hello, Bob,—what’s wrong with the world?”</p>

<p>Clifford looked up. Beside him was the plump,
smartly dressed person of Peter Loveman, smiling
amiably.</p>

<p>“Nothing much is wrong, Loveman,—except
most of my war-babies have whooping-cough.”</p>

<p>“Buck up, old scout, and come over to my table,
and let me buy you some bubble-water.”</p>

<p>“Can’t, thank you. I’m waiting for a party.”
And then Clifford, with seeming carelessness, but
watching Loveman all the while, played a bold card:
“What d’you think—I was to have had supper
here with Jack Morton. And I just learned from his
father that the young scamp has gone to Canada on
a shooting trip.”</p>

<p>Loveman showed a mild surprise; in him the
stage had lost an admirable actor. “You don’t say!
I hadn’t heard that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“His father showed me Jack’s telegram. Jack
might at least have sent me word before this,” said
Clifford.</p>

<p>“Just like Jack: a good fellow, but you can’t count
on him.” Loveman’s voice lowered. “I wonder if
our common friend, Mary Regan, has heard anything
from him.”</p>

<p>“Not unless he thinks a lot more of her than he
does of me,” Clifford grumbled.</p>

<p>“Queer situation there, isn’t it?” mused Loveman.
“Wouldn’t be surprised if he had treated her
the same as he has you.” The lawyer’s tone became
humorously lugubrious. “Well, we all have our
troubles. Here’s that little Nina Cordova. After
I’ve said a fond, swift, and eternal farewell to
twenty thousand dollars backing her in that awful
frost ‘Orange Blossoms’—honest, a guinea-hen
that’d half-swallowed an open safety-pin would pull
out its hair and eat bichloride if it had a voice like
Nina’s—here’s Nina begging me to back her in a
new piece that’s a crippled and half-witted twin to
‘Orange Blossoms.’ Can you beat it! And yet I suppose
I’ll come across. That’s just the sort of sucker
game I always fall for.”</p>

<p>With a gesture of mock despair, the little lawyer—true
lover of the best in music and the arts, and
patron of the worst—crossed to his table. Clifford
knew that Loveman, as well as himself, had been
fencing. He wondered whether he had made Loveman
believe that he believed in Jack’s northern trip,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
and that he was unconcerned about Jack and Mary.
He thought he had.</p>

<p>Clifford, alert for every possible clue, managed to
keep an eye on Loveman’s table. Presently he saw
a lithe, handsome young man in close conversation
with Loveman. It was Hilton, whom from a previous
experience he knew to be a suave adventurer in this
brilliant border-world wherein smart fashion and
glossed scoundrelism mix in easy fellowship. So then
Hilton and Loveman, for mutual advantage, had
adjusted the financial <i>contretemps</i> which had risen
when their plans had crossed that afternoon at the
Mordona. This undoubtedly meant that something
was brewing. Clifford would have given his balance
at the bank and all he could have borrowed there,
to have known the exact substance of their talk.</p>

<p>After a few minutes Hilton nodded as if some
point had been settled, and with the grace of the
professional dancer, crossed the great room and
went out. Clifford’s first impulse was to follow him,
but he thought better of it and kept his place. He
had his recompense, for a little later the dainty Nina
Cordova entered with an escort. Soon, as if by the
ordinary drifting of after-midnight merry-makers,
she, too, was conversing with Peter Loveman.</p>

<p>Again Clifford would have been glad to trade his
cash and credit that he might hear. He knew that
this girlish-looking creature had been privately fitted
into more than one of Loveman’s adroit plans of
this pleasure world; and he remembered, too, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
less than a year before there had been the beginning
of an affair between Jack and Nina—that she,
with fame glittering before her excited vision, had
dropped Jack for what she always spoke of as “her
art”; and he guessed that now, having been pushed
by managerial enterprise beyond her meager merits
as a singer in musical comedy, and having toppled
ingloriously from her lofty dreams, she might have
quite other plans.</p>

<p>If there was a plot, could Nina be in it? And if she
was in it, what was her part? And if Hilton was in it,
what was that gentleman’s rôle?</p>

<p>Nina and Loveman went off together toward three
o’clock. Clifford, alive with suspicion, followed in a
taxi—only to see Nina set down at her hotel, and
see Loveman drive straight to his apartment house
and enter. Clifford watched the windows of the
lawyer’s studio apartment, wondering if any person
had been waiting within to consult with Loveman;
but promptly at four o’clock—Loveman’s regular
hour for going to bed—the studio windows darkened.</p>

<p>Clifford had learned nothing that was definite.
But he had the sense, the result of long experience,
that he was on the trail of the parties chiefly
concerned, and that he was close upon something big—though
that something was provokingly intangible
and elusive.</p>

<p>There was but one way to handle so obscure a
situation: that was by an intensive study of every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
possibility, and the next day Clifford began upon
this slow, cautious programme. Loveman’s telephone
wires had already been tapped by the Police Department.
Clifford now took the vacant apartment above
Loveman’s and secretly installed a dictagraph in the
big studio which served Loveman as a library. Always
there were ears at these wires; and with the
help of four of Commissioner Thorne’s best plain-clothes
men, Clifford tried to keep every movement
of the suspects covered. Also he enlisted the aid
of Uncle George, in whose ears the secret doings of
Broadway were somehow mysteriously published.
Loveman came and went about his business and
pleasures, apparently as usual; Hilton was not seen
again; Nina Cordova was seen only two other times;
and once, for a few minutes in the Claridge restaurant,
Clifford saw another woman with Loveman—one
Nan Burdette, who had had a meteoric career
in New York’s pleasure life, and about whom Clifford
had heard a thing or two not at all to that
young woman’s credit. And though she never knew
it, Clifford personally kept a watch over Mary
Regan. Some way, he felt sure, Mary was involved
in this.</p>

<p>Also as part of this plan of studying all possibly
related circumstances, Clifford scrutinized every
available item of the pasts of Hilton and Nan Burdette
and Nina Cordova.</p>

<p>But for all his own effort and the efforts of those
helping him, Clifford still had little more than suspicion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
to explain the disappearance of Jack Morton.
Jack could not have vanished more clearly had gravitation
become suddenly invalidated and had he been
shot off into space in the night.</p>

<p>Clifford kept doggedly at his method. It was all
slow work, painstaking work, and tedious, tiring,
undramatic work—as all good police work is and
necessarily must be, except for now and then a turn
of luck, a moment of inspiration. But after the fifth
day following Jack’s disappearance a change was
noticeable: from the various sources of information
which Clifford had set to work, little details began
to be accumulated—bits of action that had been
seen, fragments of talk overheard by the patient
listeners on the wires. His accumulation of tiny
facts increased rapidly; and fitting the fragments
together he began to perceive the outlines of a plan,
though as yet he had no proof—a plan which, if
he was conjecturing truly, was a typical case of how
clever powers may operate through and behind the
brilliant activities of Big Pleasure—of how such
powers may subtly twist persons to their own ends,
the person never guessing what has really happened.</p>

<p>On the seventh day there came to him another
fragment which made him see his conjecture as an
even stronger possibility, which made him feel that
this hidden plan was drawing toward its climax—and
which caused him hastily to send off the following
note to Mary:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>If you wish me to help you, then you must take no
action without first referring it to me. And if any person
asks you to do any particular thing, I want you to learn
all the details of any proposed plan and then tell me,
before you give your answer. You can invent plausible
excuses for any delay.</p>
</div>

<p>The next day proved how correct had been the reasoning
that had prompted the sending of this note,
for in the afternoon he had a message that Mary
wished to see him at once. He hurried to her apartment,
quickened with suspense.</p>

<p>“Mr. Loveman has found that I am staying
here,” she began.</p>

<p>“I knew that. He was bound to find you sooner
or later. Has he asked for anything?”</p>

<p>“He has invited me out for the evening.”</p>

<p>“You are to go with him alone?”</p>

<p>“So he said.”</p>

<p>“You learned definitely where he was going to
take you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. To dinner at the Ritz—to a play at the
Empire Theater—to supper at Delmonico’s—then
dancing at that new café, Le Minuit. Shall I
accept?”</p>

<p>Clifford thought rapidly. “Certainly.”</p>

<p>“What do you think is in his mind?”</p>

<p>“Merely to entertain you,”—though Clifford
did not believe his own words,—“to try to reëstablish
himself in good standing with you.”</p>

<p>“Then how should I behave?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“Just have as good a time as you can.”</p>

<p>Clifford was cool enough until he was out of her
presence; then feverishly he considered what she had
told him. Whatever this subterranean affair might
be, if this invitation had any part in it, he reasoned
that nothing would happen at such discreet places
of entertainment as the Ritz-Carlton, the Empire
Theater, or Delmonico’s. Instinctively he knew that
the design would unfold itself, if it were to be unfolded
that evening, at Le Minuit, an establishment
which had just then caught the errant fancy of some
of the smarter social set, and naturally, therefore,
of members of the smarter set of the demi-world and
underworld.</p>

<p>His business, therefore, was to be at Le Minuit.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>AT THE MIDNIGHT CAFÉ</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Le Bain</span>, proprietor of the Grand Alcazar,
was a man of ideas and was by way of being
a bit of a monopolist in his chosen business. But
he was careful not to be his own competitor; so
when he had prospered to the point where prosperity
could be enlarged only by a second restaurant,
he took great thought that he should not injure
that excellent proposition, the Grand Alcazar. The
result of this thought was Le Minuit, which he
so named because its doors did not open until midnight.</p>

<p>Shortly after twelve Clifford, turning a few paces
off Broadway, mounted a brilliant stairway. By being
off the street floor, “The Midnight” gave a sense
(an effect carefully thought out by Monsieur Le
Bain) of privacy and also of piquant naughtiness.
He was in evening dress; patrons of the place,
male or female, had to be so garbed to pass the gold-braided
guardian who held the outer door.</p>

<p>Inside the café, Clifford was approached by a
head waiter.</p>

<p>“I want to see Monsieur Le Bain—at once,” he
said in that manner which head waiters instinctively
obey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>The head waiter vanished. The next moment
Monsieur Le Bain was approaching.</p>

<p>“Joe,” Clifford began shortly, “this joint is being
watched, and I’ve got my eyes on it, too.”</p>

<p>“Honest to God, I ain’t pullin’ nothin’ crooked
here,” responded Monsieur Le Bain, lapsing from his
French accent into the one more natural to him.</p>

<p>“You’d better not try to,” Clifford warned
grimly, looking coldly and squarely into his dark
eyes. Seeing that he had made his impression, Clifford
inquired: “Mr. Loveman come yet?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But he has a table reserved for two?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Joe, you give me a table for one, close to it, so
I can see Loveman, without being seen.”</p>

<p>“I can fix you up with a cabinet particulier,” the
other said cringingly, “if it’s privacy you want.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be alone in any cabinet particulier.
I want to be alone where I can see. You’re
going to fix that up, Joe,—and you’re not going to
pass any tip along to Mr. Loveman. Otherwise
you’ll be hearing something from the Bureau of
Licenses that won’t be healthy for your business.”</p>

<p>“Aw, now, don’t get sore,” said Monsieur Le Bain,
“it’s goin’ to be just like you say.”</p>

<p>It was. Two minutes later Clifford was in a nook
at one end of the big after-midnight restaurant, a
tubbed palm insuring him privacy from any save
those who should purposely come investigating. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
few yards away, with a placard “Reserved,” was the
table that had been indicated as Loveman’s. Along
the nearest side of the room was a row of begilded
doors, entrances into small private dining-rooms—Monsieur
Le Bain’s “cabinets particulier.” The
passing of waiters through these doors with loaded
trays, and the issuance of laughter, informed Clifford
that some of these rooms were already occupied.</p>

<p>Clifford’s job was now a waiting job; and while he
waited the appearance of Loveman and Mary Regan,
he took in the restaurant. Le Minuit, though
it advertised “newest decorations, most titillating
dishes, most astonishing entertainment,” was to
Clifford the same old thing: its only individual appeal
to the imagination was that it did not open
till midnight, and that it was reputed to be supreme
in the matter of naughty surprises. The pretentious
mural paintings—the rows of mirrors inserted in
the walls, framed with gilded plaster—the palms in
tubs—the artificial vines, with their clusters of
purple glass grapes hanging from the latticed ceiling:
all was to him a wearisome duplication. And Le
Minuit’s cabaret was the same old thing—perhaps
a bit more <i>risqué</i> than the average—except for its
great feature, one Molkarina, a native Hawaiian
dancer, who whirled and contorted and jiggled in
what New York accepted as authentic folk-dances—but
who, as Clifford knew, had never been any
nearer the much-sung island beaches than the Barbary
Coast of San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>Of the three or four hundred persons who by this
time were in the room, Clifford knew some by name,
all he knew by types. There were a few indubitable
members of the smartest social set for whom the
wildest was becoming tame and cloying; and there
were men and women hardly less well dressed, who
lived by every means except honest effort—who
were looking for pleasure and looking for prey; and
in between these showy extremes were a few work-a-day
persons who had come hither in a spirit of
daring exploration.</p>

<p>Presently Clifford saw Mary Regan, obsequiously
led by Monsieur Le Bain himself, and followed by
the urbane little Peter Loveman, make way through
the hilarious room and take possession of the reserved
table. Clifford keyed himself to watch and listen. He
sensed that he was now about to have revealed to
him the heart of this whole business.</p>

<p>Evidently Loveman had given full orders in advance,
for almost immediately supper, with champagne
in an ice pail, was brought to the table. The
talk at first was chiefly the amusing, disarming
chatter of which Loveman was a master. Then by
degrees it became more serious, then it shifted to
Mary and her plans.</p>

<p>“Let’s face the whole situation squarely, Mary,”
Clifford heard the little man say in his most plausible
voice. “I’m perfectly willing to back you up
in the original proposition—stand right behind
you—the same as I promised—if you still want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
me to. But let’s not bunk ourselves. Mary, I’m
telling you God’s truth—it’s a great game if you
could put it over—only you <i>can’t put it over</i>!”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you I’m going to try, Peter Loveman,”
she returned steadily, “and if you double-cross me,
I’ll do exactly what I said I’d do—and that means
you’ll be shown up to the Mortons and, besides,
won’t get a nickel out of them.”</p>

<p>“Now, now, Mary, let’s don’t talk threats. Whatever
the play, we’ve got to back each other’s hand;
and if your play seems the best play, I’ll be right
with you. But let’s look at the facts sensibly, Mary.
First fact, my dear: you’re basing your hope of
succeeding in your plan,—it was the original plan
of us all,—you’re building that plan, on Jack.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, Mr. Loveman?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help seeing what was in your mind,
my dear. You’ve been trying to reform Jack. You
believe that if you can steady Jack down permanently—make
a real responsible man of him, which
is what everybody else has failed to do so far—that
you’ll make yourself so solid with both of the
Mortons, so much of a necessity, that they’ll forgive
whatever you’ve done and gladly take you
on as a regular member of the family. And as a
member of the family you believe you’ll add to the
Morton dignity and prestige.”</p>

<p>“You think I can’t do that as well as any woman?”
Mary demanded.</p>

<p>“That part of it you’d do better than any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
woman!” Loveman hastened to reply. “But I’m
not talking about that. I’m talking about what
comes before that—your plan to make a man out
of Jack. You never can do that.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Several reasons. Chiefly because Jack can’t be
made a man of.”</p>

<p>“I can do it.”</p>

<p>“Mary, let’s quit kidding ourselves,” Loveman
returned gravely, quietly. “Unless you’re with
Jack constantly you can’t influence him. And if
you’ve seen Jack during the last ten days you’ve
done more than any one else has.”</p>

<p>Mary tried to speak calmly. “Jack recently left
New York on a hunting trip.”</p>

<p>Loveman shook his head. “Shooting would never
take Jack away from New York; certainly not for
ten days. He’s just—I think you understand.”
He regarded Mary keenly. “You know Jack’s old
reputation; he used to show more speed than any
man who ever entered the Broadway Free-for-All.
He never cared much for song—but he was all for
the other two members of the old trio. The last
bottle was Jack’s quitting place, and daybreak was
his bedtime.”</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Mary.</p>

<p>Loveman answered slowly. “There’s a rumor
about that Jack’s his old self once more; that secretly
he’s been in New York all the while, and
that Broadway’s got him again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“I don’t believe it!” cried Mary in a low voice.</p>

<p>“And I do,” Loveman said solemnly—“though
I have no proof.”</p>

<p>Clifford could see that Mary, gazing across at the
little lawyer, had turned very white. For all her
confident exterior, he guessed she now feared that
Jack had done just what Loveman had said.</p>

<p>“Well?” she challenged.</p>

<p>“If Jack has,—and I’m sure he has,—isn’t it
perfectly plain that you can never make a responsible
man of him? And if you can’t make a man of
him, it’s perfectly plain that you can never put
your plan across.”</p>

<p>“Well?” repeated Mary.</p>

<p>Loveman leaned farther over the table and spoke
in a low voice—though Clifford got his every word.
“Drop the game, Mary. It’s a dead one. There’s
not one penny for you, or any one else, in trying to
play it further. Drop it, and come in on the basis
I spoke of a week or so ago.”</p>

<p>Mary’s face gave no sign of what she might be
thinking. “Just what was that—if you don’t mind
outlining it again?”</p>

<p>“First item: I don’t need to remind you that
I’m retained by Mr. Morton to look after Jack;
say in a week I bring in a report that Jack has contracted
a secret marriage—which means a bill for
ten thousand for detective services, which I’ll split
with you. Second item: he’ll want a divorce; I’ll
handle the case and get a big fee—that’s where I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
come in. You’ll not fight, if he’ll pay high enough;
that’s where you clean up between a hundred thousand
and half a million—and being on the inside
I’ll be in a position to tell you the top figure that
Morton will pay. And third item: freed of this mess,
and with Mrs. Jack Morton as your legal name,
there’s no end to the big propositions I could put
across for and with you—you with your looks and
brains, and I with my inside knowledge of New
York domestic life. Big stuff—big, I tell you! I
could land you close to the top!”</p>

<p>His enthusiasm, which had mounted as he spoke,
now abated to a tone of solid, unanswerable argument.
“That’s why I say to you to drop your
present impossible game, and come into these new
propositions.”</p>

<p>She did not answer at once; so that he was led to
prompt her: “That’s plain enough, isn’t it, Mary?—that
the thing to do is to stop thinking about
Jack and come in on these other lines?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she answered steadily. “But first,
I’ve got to find out about Jack. I don’t believe what
you believe.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m disappointed—though perhaps I
don’t blame you. But the proposition stands open.”</p>

<p>With the philosophic sigh of the man to whom the
world has taught patience, he fell upon the remainder
of his half of the guinea-hen. Clifford saw him rub
his napkin twice across his mouth, place it upon
his knees, from where it slipped to the floor—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
may or may not have been a signal. But, at any rate,
the next moment a waiter, who had been standing
close at hand, opened the door of the nearest cabinet
particulier. “Did you ring?” he said, and stepping
inside left the door open. Mary’s gaze, wandering
from her table-mate, went through the doorway,
and she saw, what Clifford also saw from his retreat:
Jack Morton, his features soddenly loose, leaning
in a stupor against the shoulder of a woman.</p>

<p>She stared fixedly at this picture so unexpectedly
enframed by the doorway; then involuntarily there
burst from her lips:—</p>

<p>“Good God—look!”</p>

<p>Loveman raised his eyes from his guinea-hen, and
followed her gaze. “Well—of all things!”</p>

<p>The waiter, coming out, closed the door, and
the brief picture was gone. Then Loveman turned
on Mary, his big eyes wide with amazement.</p>

<p>“That certainly is some jolt! Not that I’m surprised
at the fact—only surprised at our coming
on it like this.”</p>

<p>Clifford saw that he regarded her keenly. She was
very pale and strained, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“Well, who guessed right?” he ventured after a
moment. Then, more confidently: “That ought to
settle matters, Mary. There’s nothing else to it—you’re
coming in on the new line.”</p>

<p>Again Mary did not speak. But for Loveman
there was no need for her to speak. Clifford easily
guessed what was passing in his mind. The danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
which she represented to Loveman was now averted;
the plans which he was going to carry out with her
were already successes. His active brain was leaping
months, even years, ahead. This was one of the
big moments of his life—one of those few moments
when a series of great achievements become
suddenly possible.</p>

<p>But Clifford could not see into the soul of Mary
Regan; tensely he wondered what was passing
therein—and waited.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>MARY MAKES AN OFFER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>, gazing at that little door, was, for all her
composed exterior, sick of soul: contrary emotions
and impulses clashed within her. A fury suddenly
possessed her. She had lost—been defeated in her
great plan by the invertebrateness of one man. Well,
Jack could go his champagne-bottled way to the inevitable
end of such as he! She was through!...
And then she remembered Maisie Jones, admiring
tears in her proud eyes, and she recalled her trembling
words of belief: “You can do what I can never
do—you’ve proved that you can make a real man
of Jack.”</p>

<p>She rose quickly. “I’m going to get him,” she
breathed huskily.</p>

<p>“Wait—you mustn’t!” cried Loveman in alarm,
starting up and clutching at her wrist.</p>

<p>But she eluded him, and made for the little door
of the cabinet particulier, he at her skirt—and Clifford
just behind them. What they all saw was a
tricksy, ornate room, lighted with imitation electric
candles; Jack now toppled forward limp and unconscious
among the dishes; and about the table Nina
Cordova, Hilton, that polished adventurer of the
smart hotels, and Nan Burdette, high-colored, bold-eyed
café favorite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>Mary moved inside, Loveman at her heels. But
Clifford remained without, waiting. The situation
was Mary’s—for her to face, for her to reveal herself
by.</p>

<p>Mary stepped quickly forward and shook Jack’s
shoulder. “Jack—wake up! Come on out of this!”</p>

<p>Jack, a limp weight, showed no life, but the other
three did. Nan Burdette sprang up.</p>

<p>“Stop that! What d’you think you’re doing?”</p>

<p>Mary flamed at her—and at Nina Cordova—and
at Hilton. “I’m going to take him away from
you blood-suckers,” she said with cold fury.</p>

<p>“You call me that—” the café beauty was beginning
angrily, when Nina Cordova, the petite,
rose and checked her. “Shut up, Nan!” She leaned
toward Mary, and spoke cuttingly, “Why, if it
isn’t the little dame that Jack lived with, and got
tired of, and then gave the grand shake. Well, little
one, what are you going to do with your darling
sweetheart who loves you so much that he’s run
away to avoid the sight of you?”</p>

<p>Mary’s voice was chokingly composed. She returned
the other’s ironical gaze with a glare of contempt.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take him away from you people—to
where he can sober up—have a chance to
think about it all—become himself. That’s what
I’m going to do.”</p>

<p>“And what good’ll that do you?” pursued Nina
cuttingly—“since he’s all through with you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“What he thinks of me has nothing to do with the
case,” Mary returned.</p>

<p>“Mary, it’s no use—keep out of this!” cried
little Loveman. He took her arm to draw her away,
but she shook him off.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do exactly what I said I’d do.
Come on, Jack.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not!” Nina cried, suddenly sharp and
venomous, leaning farther across the table. “You
just try to start anything like that and I’ll tell the
Mortons who you really are—<i>Miss Mary Regan</i>!”</p>

<p>Hilton, finished gentleman of hotel, café, and
ballroom, had moved around the table to her side.
“And start anything, and <i>I’ll</i> tell what I know,” he
said in a hard voice, his hands twitching. “And it’ll
be something besides what Miss Cordova will tell.
I believe you get me, Mrs. Mary Regan Grayson!”</p>

<p>“And we won’t put off telling till to-morrow!”
cried Nina Cordova. She moved quickly to a little
wall telephone, tinted in gray-and-gold to match
the room, and took down the receiver.</p>

<p>“Give me the Biltmore.... The Biltmore? Connect
me with Mr. Morton.... Mr. Morton, this is
Miss Cordova. Will you please hold the wire a moment.”</p>

<p>She muffled the mouthpiece with a palm and
turned upon Mary. “Get out of this—or your
finish will come in just one second!”</p>

<p>Clifford’s eyes, taking in all, were centered on
Mary, who was gazing at all these faces bent upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
her in menace. He saw that her impulses had come
to a sudden halt; that she realized that these persons
could, and would, do exactly what they threatened;
that their telling would mean an immediate end to
the ambitious plans for which she had schemed and
worked and waited so hard.</p>

<p>There was silence in the little cabinet particulier;
all the figures, save Jack’s, stood in tense tableau—waiting.
Clifford, looking through the aperture of
the door, recognized that this was a climax in Mary
Regan’s life. Events, with some guidance from
him had arranged a supreme test. The next instant
would prove something—what? He was as taut as
those within.</p>

<p>Mary, with slow calm, drew a deep breath; her
figure stiffened. “Mr. Hilton, Miss Cordova,” she
said steadily, slowly, her eyes not leaving them, “you
may tell everything you like. I am going to take
Jack away from here.”</p>

<p>At her words an exultant thrill leaped through
Clifford. She had had her choice—and had chosen
the way of her own destruction!</p>

<p>Mary put an arm under Jack’s shoulders. “Stop
that!” cried Nina, in sudden fury, dropping the telephone
receiver and clutching the unconscious Jack,
so that he was torn away from Mary’s arm. With
energetic fury she turned on Loveman. “Peter
Loveman, make her stop! You promised me, if I’d
come into this, you’d fix up a marriage between
Jack and me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“Shut up, Nina!” Loveman cut in sharply, in
half panic. “Mary,” he cried, seizing her arm,
“come on—let’s leave her—quick!”</p>

<p>But the lithe Hilton did not depend upon the influence
of mere words. From somewhere out of his
elegant person he drew a small pistol, and this he
thrust against Mary’s side.</p>

<p>“Get out of this,” he snapped, “or this gun goes
off! And we’ll all swear it was suicide. The gun’s
a lady’s size, and suicides are common in joints like
this. Get out!”</p>

<p>Mary did not quiver—she looked Hilton squarely
in his handsome, evil face. At that instant Clifford
stepped swiftly into the room and closed the light
door behind him. The next instant he had wrenched
the pistol from Hilton’s hand, and pocketed it, and
had seized both Hilton and Loveman by their collars.</p>

<p>“Cut out that rough stuff, Hilton, or I finish you
off here!” he said. “And so, Loveman, I’ve got you
at it again?”</p>

<p>The little lawyer twisted about—gave Clifford
a startled stare—and then forced a smile intended
to be tolerant, but which was sickly. “Why, Bob,
I don’t know a thing about this—”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” snapped Clifford.</p>

<p>He turned to Mary, who was still bewildered by
his sudden appearance, and again the leaping thrill
went through him. “Mary, you’ve gone through
this great! Great, I tell you. And these people—don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
worry about them another minute. You’ve
won out!”</p>

<p>Mary stared at him, now breathing quickly. “I
don’t quite—understand.”</p>

<p>“You were not supposed to understand. There
has been a big, careful, subtle plan,—a plot devised
by Peter Loveman,—and you, without knowing
it, were to have been the goat!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say now, Bob!” protested Loveman;
“you’re talking like a melodrama. Why should I
plot against Mary?”</p>

<p>“Why? Listen to your own words—you know
whom you said them to.” And Clifford quoted,
driving his words savagely at Loveman: “‘Say,
but this is one hell of a situation! Here I went into
a game to clean up in three or four directions, relying
chiefly on the criminal instincts of a clever girl
to see the game through—and, damn it, if the girl
hasn’t turned straight on me! Or, if she is playing
a crooked game, she’s trying to play it straight.
And the original game is no good now—is sure to
fail. I want her to quit it, and come in on some other
big proposition; but she won’t quit it—she still
dreams she can put it over. And if I openly block
her, she’ll blow on herself and me, and break with
me, and that’ll end everything. How’s that for a
hell of a fix!’ Remember saying that, Loveman?”</p>

<p>Loveman had paled. “I don’t know what you’re
talking about.”</p>

<p>“And remember saying this, Loveman?” Clifford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
drove at him: “‘I’ve got to have Mary Regan
with us. But the only way out of this mess is to
handle affairs so as to make her believe, from her own
experience, that she can’t succeed in her respectable
game—then she’ll come around to our way of
thinking, and she’ll try to clean up with us. And
there’s only one way to reach her—and that’s
through Jack Morton.’”</p>

<p>Clifford turned sharply upon Mary. “Isn’t it
clear to you now?—Jack’s disappearance and all
the rest? Loveman was determined your plan with
Jack Morton should not go ahead. Since he didn’t
dare openly oppose you, he concluded that the best
scheme to defeat you would be to get hold of Jack
and handle him so that he would give himself over
completely to dissipation—that would show you
how hopeless your plan was, and you’d drop it.
You’ve been framed, and Jack’s been framed; and
this wine party in here was part of the frame-up;
and Loveman’s letting you have a glimpse, as if by
chance, of Jack in here, a hopeless <i>débauché</i>, was to
have been the clinching argument that would make
you give up and join in with him.”</p>

<p>“Clifford,” blustered Loveman, “everything you
have just said is a lie!—and Mary knows it.”</p>

<p>“Loveman,” returned Clifford in grim wrath,
“even though you are a small man, I’d hit you in
the face if I didn’t think it might improve your
features.” He turned again to Mary. “Hilton and
Nan Burdette have been Loveman’s chief tools for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
keeping Jack drunk and out of sight; they’re both
experts at such business. Miss Cordova has been in
it to help out in some of the finer points; she’s an
old-time friend of Jack, and you’ve just learned of
an ambition of her own. That’s the case, Miss Regan.
I don’t feel like praising Jack, but it’s only
fair to him to emphasize that he’s not here because
he tired of you, as they’ve tried to make you think.
I want you to understand clearly that Jack is the
victim of this smooth bunch; that whatever he felt
toward you two weeks ago, he doubtless still feels;
that whatever he then was, he probably still is.”</p>

<p>“A lot of good that’ll do her, when I tell what I
know!” burst out the infuriated Miss Cordova.</p>

<p>“And I can tell a little that will help,” grimly
added Nan Burdette.</p>

<p>There was a glitter in Hilton’s dark eyes, and he
bared his white teeth. “And what I’ve got to tell
will jam up her game even worse! You and she are
not going to get away with this!”</p>

<p>“The three of you are going to say exactly nothing!
Nan Burdette,”—with sudden incisiveness,—“I
know your part in that Gordon affair. Miss
Cordova, I’ve got more than a hunch about that
pearl necklace Mrs. Sinclair gave her husband to
have repaired and which strangely disappeared. And,
Hilton, I’ve got a lead about a certain lady who
fainted—she really drank drugged tea—at an
afternoon dance at the Grantham and whose diamond
brooch was not afterwards found. I’d run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
every one of you in this minute—only I’d rather
keep things quiet and give Miss Regan her chance
to do just as she pleases concerning Jack Morton.
But if there is one word—and I’ll know it, if there
is—if there’s one word from any of you that
touches on Miss Regan, I’ll get every one of you!”</p>

<p>He turned sharply on Loveman. “These are
your people, Peter Loveman; working under your
orders. You tell them to keep their mouths closed
about Miss Regan; if there’s a peep, something
very unexpected is also going to happen to you.”</p>

<p>“See here, Clifford,” protested Loveman, “I’ve
no control over them!”</p>

<p>“Believe it or not, Loveman, but I’ve got you,
too,” Clifford retorted sharply, “only I’d rather
not close in on you just yet unless you make me.
You’ll give them that order and see that they obey
it, or you’ll get what you’ll get!”</p>

<p>Loveman gazed for a moment longer into Clifford’s
set face. Then with a feeble attempt at a
pleasant smile he turned to the others:—</p>

<p>“I guess you all understand that I’d like to have
you do as Mr. Clifford says.”</p>

<p>“That’s all,” said Clifford sharply. “Now, get
out of here—all of you. You can settle your bills
outside. I give you just one minute.”</p>

<p>Within the minute they were gone. Mary and
Clifford, alone in the little room, Jack still pitched
unconsciously forward upon the table, looked at
each other for a long space. Despite the fake Hawaiian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
music and the laughter of the mixed world
of Le Minuit, which sounded through the thin partitions,
there was in reality a deep silence between
them.</p>

<p>“I want to thank you—I want to thank you very
much,” breathed Mary, at length.</p>

<p>He seemed not to hear her halting words. “Do
you know what is the really big thing about all this?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>He spoke very quickly. “By your action a few
minutes ago, you proved that you are not wholly
the worldly person you thought you were. The risks
you then took were not to save your ambitious
plan; you took them to save Jack. You forgot yourself.
Through your own scheming Life placed a responsibility
on you—and you accepted it. That
is the big thing!”</p>

<p>She stared at him, bewildered questioning in her
pale, dark face. He saw that she still did not understand
herself—the impulses which had moved her—and
which might still be moving her. For a moment
she did not speak. Then she asked, looking
down at Jack:—</p>

<p>“But what am I to do now?”</p>

<p>“That is for you to decide. When you have decided,
I’ll help you.”</p>

<p>“If I take Jack from here—” She broke off; and
stood gazing thoughtfully at the stupefied boy.
“It would do no good unless—unless—”</p>

<p>Again she left her sentence uncompleted. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
insistent ringing of the little telephone, whose receiver
was still dangling, caught her attention. She
walked with a manner of decision to the telephone.</p>

<p>“Central, please get me the Biltmore,” she requested
steadily. “This the Biltmore? Please connect
me with Mr. Morton.... Is this Mr. Morton?
Mr. Morton, this is Mrs. Grayson—Miss
Gilmore, you know. I am now at Le Minuit. I
wonder if you would care to meet me here....
Very well, in ten minutes, then. I’ll be waiting in
a taxi-cab down in front.... My answer to your
invitation? Yes—if you want my answer, I’ll
have it ready.”</p>

<p>She hung up.</p>

<p>“He was referring to that cruise with him?”
asked Clifford.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Clifford regarded her curiously: What was her purpose
in summoning Mr. Morton into this situation?</p>

<p>“I want to get Jack down into a taxi-cab,” Mary
went on. “How can I do it?—and without attracting
attention?”</p>

<p>“That’s easy. Nothing of that sort attracts attention
at Le Minuit.”</p>

<p>He pressed a button, and from the waiter who
appeared he demanded the immediate presence of
Monsieur Le Bain. Two minutes later the proprietor
entered.</p>

<p>“Joe,” Clifford ordered briefly, “get Mr. Morton’s
things, whatever they are, and have two of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
your waiters help him down into a taxi, and have
the taxi wait till we come down. Everything quiet,
mind you.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the Frenchman from somewhere
below Fourteenth Street.</p>

<p>Presently two waiters supported the still stupefied
Jack out of the room; a little later Clifford
and Mary passed unheeded through the hilarious
patrons of Le Minuit, down the stairway, and
across the light-flooded sidewalk out into the waiting
taxi-cab, in one corner of which Jack huddled
limply. Here they sat silent, waiting. Clifford had
a sense that it was not the old Mary Regan beside
whom he sat—but that new Mary Regan who did
not know herself: and he had a sense that, with her
at least, big issues were still at stake.</p>

<p>Presently another taxi rapidly turned the corner
and came to a pause just behind them. Out of this
the elder Morton stepped.</p>

<p>“Wait here for a moment, please,” Mary said to
Clifford. She stepped out upon the brilliant sidewalk—and
Clifford looked on, wondering.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Gilmore!” cried Morton, swiftly coming
to her with an eager, expectant smile. “You
were an angel to call me up—after not letting me
see you for so long! Though,” he quickly added in
soft complaint, “it wasn’t very kind of you to run
away from me as you did.”</p>

<p>“You advised me to leave the Grantham,” she
reminded him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“Yes, but I didn’t advise you to go leaving me
in ignorance of your whereabouts,” he returned in
an amiably hurt tone. “And that—ah—little
present: was it kind to return it, without a word,
the way you did?”</p>

<p>“You mean that ten thousand dollars? I did not
need the money.”</p>

<p>“No?” He smiled. “I thought a woman always
needed money.—Well, my dear, now that I’ve found
you again I hope there’ll never be another such
dreary hiatus in our friendship. You’re looking—but
I’m no poet! And at last I’m to have my
answer?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>“Good! I’ve had that yacht put in commission.
Everything is waiting. When’ll you be ready to
go?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Not going! The devil you say!”</p>

<p>He stared at her white, set face. Dominated by
his own pleasant conception of this situation, he
had not till then really noted her bearing. He was
completely taken aback.</p>

<p>“Well—you have your nerve! Then why did
you ask me to come over here, and at such an hour?”</p>

<p>“I thought you might like to see your son.”</p>

<p>“Jack!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She nodded. “He’s in here”—and moving back
a pace she pointed into the car.</p>

<p>“My God—Jack!” breathed his father, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
sighted the limp, exhausted figure. Then he saw
Clifford. “You, Clifford!” he exclaimed sharply.
“Where’d you find him?”</p>

<p>Clifford stepped from the car. “I didn’t find
him. Miss Gilmore found him.”</p>

<p>Morton turned swiftly upon Mary. “So you’ve
broken your promise and had him all this time!”
he cried harshly. “You brought him to this!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Mr. Morton,” Clifford shot in. “Miss
Gilmore had not seen him till to-night. To-night
she found him in the drunken company he’s been
in for ten days. She got him away from them and
sent for you. The least a gentleman—particularly a
gentleman who has taken such poor care of his son—can
do under the conditions is to try to apologize.”</p>

<p>Morton glowered at Clifford. “If that’s the case,
of course, I apologize. But the question is, where’s
he been all this time?”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” put in Mary in the same quiet
voice, “that the most important question is, what
are you going to do with him?”</p>

<p>“Do with him?” demanded Morton, staring at
her. “What’s in your mind?”</p>

<p>Clifford had been, and still was, asking himself
those same questions.</p>

<p>Mary, standing between the two men, gazed very
calmly at Mr. Morton. “You’ve had Jack in charge
for twenty-five years—and in there you see your
work. He was with me awhile; during that short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
time he tried to be, and was, a man. It’s up to you
to choose.”</p>

<p>Morton stared—blinked his eyes—drew a deep
breath. “Am I getting you right? Are you suggesting
that Jack come back to you?”</p>

<p>Clifford now began to understand; though he had
no idea—nor perhaps did she, for that matter,—of
the degree to which she was moved by the tearful
figure of Maisie Jones, breathing, “You are big—wonderful!”</p>

<p>“I think I might make a man of him,” she said.</p>

<p>“You mean to resume on the old basis—the discreet
Riverside Drive affair—and all that?”</p>

<p>“Just that. I’ll do my best for him—provided
he comes with your knowledge and consent.”</p>

<p>He gazed at her intently. “You’re a new kind to
me!” Then, dryly: “No, thank you.”</p>

<p>“I shall never ask you for a single thing,” she
urged.</p>

<p>He gazed at her, hesitating. It was not given to
any of the trio to see then what a moment of great
crisis this was. It was like the apex of so many of
Life’s crises—very quiet, very composed.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” Mr. Morton said with decision.
“I have other plans for him. I shall now handle him
myself.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say. But remember, I made you
an offer.” Her calm expression did not change by
a flicker. “Under the circumstances, the simplest
arrangement would be for us merely to exchange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
taxis. I suggest that you take my taxi with your son.
With your permission I’ll take your cab. Good-night.”</p>

<p>She turned about, with her composed air of finality.
“Will you please help me in, Mr. Clifford?”</p>

<p>Clifford did so. Over his shoulder he had a glimpse
of the handsome, elderly man standing, loose-jawed,
staring after her.</p>

<p>As Clifford settled beside her and the car sprang
away, there was a sharp, breaking choke from her,
and she dropped her face into her hands. After that
she gripped herself and sat silent, rigid, as the car
spun on. Clifford, gazing on her, wondered thrillingly
what was happening within that taut figure
... wondered what might happen in the days to
come....</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>LOVEMAN’S FINAL PLEA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the taxi-cab spun northward through the two-o’clock
streets, Clifford continued to gaze at the
taut figure of Mary Regan, and at her white, set
face. It had certainly been an hour to try her soul,
that experience ending a few minutes since at the
Midnight Café.</p>

<p>To Clifford it seemed that all Mary’s shrewd
scheming had brought her up at last against an unsurmountable
wall. Again Clifford wondered what
was passing behind that pale face: wondered what
was going to be the ending of her great worldly plan,
which thus far had had so many undreamed-of developments:
wondered how all this tangled affair was
going to come out for her—and again wondered
which of the two persons he knew in her was to be
the dominant Mary Regan when this matter had
played itself through to its unguessable conclusion.</p>

<p>The taxi-cab halted, and Clifford escorted her to
the door of her apartment house.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do next, if you don’t mind
telling?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet—perhaps nothing,” she said
absently. And then, with quiet vigor: “Jack’s not
to blame so much for what he is. It’s chiefly his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
father’s fault. I wish I could make his father pay!”
Her dark eyes flashed, her figure tensed with sudden
purpose. “Yes, somehow I am going to make his
father pay!”</p>

<p>She held out her hand, and gave him a steady
look. “At any rate, I want to thank you. You’ve
done all you could for me. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night.”</p>

<p>He watched her in—this strange, confident
young woman, so tangled in the web of her own
spinning, whom he had drifted into so strangely
helping, and whom, though she could now have
no part in his life, he knew he still loved. But back
in the taxi-cab, his mind at once was on another
matter. He had glimpsed Peter Loveman lurking
within the doorway during the end of that scene in
front of Le Minuit; and he knew that keen little
lawyer was no man to give up merely because he
seemed to be beaten. In fact Loveman would act
all the more quickly for just that reason.</p>

<p>Clifford drove two blocks to the south, a block
west, and a block north, then, ordering his cab to
wait, he stepped out and walked north to the next
corner. He peered around this and waited. Presently
he saw what he more than half expected to
see—Loveman crossing from a taxi to the entrance
of Mary’s apartment house. He saw him press
Mary’s button, and after a space saw Loveman
push open the door and enter.</p>

<p>Clifford tried to guess what plan the little lawyer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
whose wiles he had exposed to Mary only an hour
before at Le Minuit, could regard as so important
that it had to be undertaken at two o’clock in the
morning, without the loss of a single possible minute.
He wanted to slip down the street, enter the house,
and try to watch and overhear; but the chauffeur in
Loveman’s waiting taxi might also be Loveman’s
lookout and personal guard. There was nothing for
it but to wait where he was and watch.</p>

<p>Within, up on the fourth floor, Mary stood outside
her open door, looking down into the dark,
narrow stairway, with its sharp turns and tiny landings.
When the dim, mounting figure started up the
last flight and she saw it was Loveman, she drew
sharply back and tried to close her door. But Loveman,
quick despite his plump figure, sprang up the
final steps and thrust his walking-stick into the closing
aperture. He tried to force the door with his
shoulder, but Mary’s strength on the other side was
fully equal to his own and the door did not budge. He
desisted, but kept the advantage held by his walking-stick.</p>

<p>“Come, Mary, my dear, don’t be so inhospitable,”
he said through the crack, in a pleasantly complaining
voice. “You know, I wouldn’t have come
at such an hour unless it was important. And you
know I’m your friend.”</p>

<p>The door did not move.</p>

<p>“This is a raw way to treat your old nurse and
playmate,” complained Loveman. “Particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
when I’ve come to tell you something that it’s your
business to know—something about Jack.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence. Then suddenly
the door swung wide open, and Loveman found
himself looking at a small automatic and beyond that
at the cold face of Mary.</p>

<p>“Come in, but behave yourself,” she said briefly.</p>

<p>He entered and closed the door. “Your suspicion
hurts me, Mary, dear,” he said in his amiably injured
tone. He raised his two hands, one holding the
cane and the other his silk hat, high above his shining
dome. “Just to allay your suspicions, so we can talk
as good friends should talk, I suggest that you first
frisk me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, and don’t try to be humorous.
Put down your hands. I don’t care how many guns
you have—I can beat you to the first shot—and
there’ll be only one shot. What do you want?”</p>

<p>Loveman lowered his hands and laid stick and
hat upon a table. “Mind if an asthmatic, dropsical,
and almost moribund gentleman sits down while he
talks?” He eased himself into a chair without waiting
her consent. “Sit down, too, Mary. If you’re
going to murder me, let’s make it a comfortable
affair for both of us.”</p>

<p>She took a chair, and sat alert with automatic
held in her lap. “What do you want?” she repeated.</p>

<p>“First?” he replied with a smile of amiable frankness,
“I’ve got to say that on the surface you do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
seem to have every reason to suspect me. The way
that business at Le Minuit turned out, and especially
the way Clifford twisted it, it did look as
though I’d tried to do you dirt. But those were
only the looks—they were not the facts.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to deny that that affair was a
frame-up?” she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>“I do not, for it was,” he returned promptly.
“Further, it was a frame-up chiefly against you.
That brings me to the point that made me hurry
here—a point that had to have immediate explanation.
It was a frame-up, yes—but, honest, Mary,
I framed you for your own good.”</p>

<p>“For my own good!” she exclaimed skeptically.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Listen, Mary. I’ve got to repeat myself—but
I can’t help that if I am to make myself
clear. Your big idea in this secret marriage with
Jack Morton has grown to be to keep Jack at work—to
do what no one else has ever been able to do,
make a man out of him—so that after a time,
when the big blow-off comes and they find out who
you are, you will have established yourself so thoroughly
by the service you have rendered that the
Mortons will have to overlook everything shady
about your past and your part in this affair. That’s
the way you had it doped out to yourself, now,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Mary did not answer.</p>

<p>“That was your plan—exactly. And your plan,
all the big future you saw for yourself, was based<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
upon your making a man out of Jack. Mary,—I’m
talking straight goods now,—I saw you could
never make a man out of Jack. Nobody could or
can. The stuff’s not there. I saw you were headed
toward certain failure—and wasting good months,
and big chances, in trying to put your grand dream
across. I told you all this and tried to talk you
out of it, but you wouldn’t listen to me. So I decided
to try to prove my point by showing you the
facts. I decided to frame you.</p>

<p>“To-night, I let you stumble across, as if by accident,
Jack chloroformed by grape juice and in
the company of those ladies. I admit I helped lead
Jack into that. But I hoped you would see it as the
real thing, see how hopeless any dream was that
was based on making a man of Jack—and that
you would quit the game right there. But my little
act was a fizzle. Still, Mary,”—and the little lawyer’s
voice was persuasively emphatic,—“even
though Jack was led into this to-night, the picture
you saw of him, that wine and woman stuff, is an
honest-to-God picture of what Jack will be in a few
months. Broadway hasn’t yet got him completely—but
Broadway is going to get him! I’m telling
you, Mary!”</p>

<p>Mary’s face was expressionless. “You didn’t
come here merely to deliver that speech, Peter
Loveman.”</p>

<p>“Naturally, there is something else.” His round,
large eyes regarded her meditatively; then he leaned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
forward. “Mary, I’m going to lay all my cards
on the table. First, here’s a bit of a confession:
I hung around Le Minuit, and heard your offer to
Mr. Morton to straighten Jack out, and heard him
turn you down flat, and saw him drive away with
Jack.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that just so much more evidence to show
you that your big dream can never, never come
true?” he argued, quietly, but with the driving force
of the great lawyer that he was. “So I say again, for
God’s sake, drop it all! And, Mary,—you’d never
have been happy even if you had worked that game
with the Mortons. You’re too much the daughter
of ‘Gentleman Jim’ Regan for that sort of life—your
father’s blood would have sent you back to the
old ways.</p>

<p>“Listen, Mary,—the sensible thing to do is for us
all to cash in on this Morton affair, before it breaks.
I’ve said most of this before, but I’ve got to say it
again. Let me discover the secret marriage between
you and Jack; I’ll soak Mr. Morton hard for a detective
bill, and give you a half of what he pays.
And by playing the thing this way, I’ll keep solid
with Mr. Morton and will be in a position where
I can milk him for a long time to come. And then,
of course, you’ll make him pay big for a divorce— Morton
will want to hush the matter up as far as
he can, and he’ll want to keep details out of court.
And since I’ll be representing Mr. Morton, I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
put you wise to the very limit he’ll pay. What you
get there will be all your own; I’ll get mine out of
handling Mr. Morton’s end. And that business all
settled, and you with the name of Mrs. Jack Morton—why,
there’s nothing big we couldn’t put across
as team-mates! And everything safe—and everything
big! And a little later, if you wanted it, I
could, by watching chances and playing the cards
right, help you make a marriage that would be a
headliner in regard to wealth and respectability and
position. Don’t you see it all!”</p>

<p>She saw it, and it was a dazzling vision of its own
kind. Moreover, she knew this shrewd little lawyer
could bring it all to pass. And among other things
his plan offered was the definite and immediate
chance to strike vengefully at Mr. Morton, who an
hour before had so coolly rebuffed her when, swayed
by unaccustomed emotion, she had made him the
proposal to devote herself to Jack.</p>

<p>At length she spoke. “That was another good
speech, Peter,” she said quietly, “but you didn’t
come here merely to deliver that speech either.
Just what is the big thing that’s in your mind?”</p>

<p>“Why, that you should drop your present game,
instanter, and switch to something worth while.”</p>

<p>“That’s not what brought you here between two
and three o’clock in the morning,” she insisted
steadily.</p>

<p>He shifted slightly. “It’s like this, Mary,” he said
abruptly, changing from his persuasive tone—“you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
and I went into this thing together, and I hope
we’re going to stick it out together along the lines
I’ve just suggested. But matters took such a twist
with to-night’s events that I had to know definitely,
at once, whether you were going to work
along with me.”</p>

<p>“And that’s the question you really want answered?”</p>

<p>“It is. And I’m hoping your answer is going to
be ‘yes.’”</p>

<p>“I do not know what I am going to do,” she said
quietly, her dark eyes fixed upon his large blue ones.
“But whatever I do, I shall do alone and exactly as
I please.”</p>

<p>He slowly wet his full, loose lips. “Is that
final?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“You mean that you are going to leave me out
of it.”</p>

<p>“I am not going to think of you one way or the
other.” She stood up. “If that is all you came for,
I suggest you now say good-night.”</p>

<p>His soft hands gripped the arms of his chair.
Fury flamed within him; words of menace surged to
his lips. But Peter Loveman never had more self-possession
than when his situation was most dangerous—and
dangerous he certainly now felt it to be.
So as he rose he smiled with good-natured regret.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry it’s all off, Mary; it would have
been big for us both. But you have the right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
do as you choose. Well, good luck to you—and
good-night.”</p>

<p>With a look of almost fatherly benignity, Loveman
went out. Mary suspected that regretful,
genial smile—but she thought of it only for a moment,
for the next instant her mind was on other
things. She switched out her lights, and stepping
to a window she looked out into the deep silence of
the night.</p>

<p>What should she do? At last she was alone face
to face with her life’s greatest crisis. She had played
for big game—for wealth and worldly position—and
she had played daringly—and now, at the
end, after all her time and bold dreams and care
and cleverness, it seemed that she had lost, and
lost finally, unalterably. And after all, even had
she won, would the winning have been worth the
while?...</p>

<p>And then there was a resurgence of that self-confidence,
that determination, which were such strong
elements of her nature. Should she not make one last
desperate effort to carry through her plan, despite
them all? Her resentment toward Jack’s cold,
worldly father suddenly flamed high. Just to balk
the older Morton she would like to save Jack and
win out herself.</p>

<p>But how might it be done?... Almost unconsciously
her mind began to revert with nervous intensity
to certain methods of that period spent under
the influence of her father and later of her uncle Joe—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
period of artful criminality that she had
long thought of as forever ended. By use of her old
skill she might so outwit Jack’s father, might so
involve him, that he would gladly come to terms.</p>

<p>She stood there in the silent dark, thinking feverishly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>TWO PLEASANT GENTLEMEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Clifford saw Loveman leave the apartment
house and cross rapidly to his cab, he waited to see
no more. His next move, as he had planned it, was
based upon conjecture, and it had to be executed
without a lost moment. He ran back to his waiting
taxi-cab, gave the chauffeur Loveman’s address, and
thrust a ten-dollar bill into the man’s hands.</p>

<p>“Keep the change, and forget the speed laws,”
Clifford exclaimed as he sprang in.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the rocking machine turned
into Loveman’s street. Save for his own car, the
street was empty. Not waiting for the machine to
slow down, Clifford called “Beat it!” to the chauffeur,
leaped to the curb and walked rapidly into
Loveman’s apartment house. At the end of the corridor
a negro youth lay loosely a-sprawl and snoring
on the telephone switchboard, and the elevator
door stood open. The sight reassured Clifford on
one point: he had beaten Loveman to his home—that
is, if Loveman’s purpose had been to come
home.</p>

<p>Noiselessly, Clifford crossed to the stairway beside
the elevator and ran up flight after flight, until he
came breathlessly to the twelfth floor, the floor above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
Loveman’s studio apartment. He let himself through
a door with a latch-key, and the next moment, sitting
in the darkness, he had on the headpiece of a
dictagraph whose wires ran down into the lofty
studio which Loveman used as his library. Two or
three minutes passed—then he heard some one
enter below—then he heard a deep, gruff, unmistakable
voice:—</p>

<p>“God, Loveman—thought you were never going
to show up.”</p>

<p>His conjecture had been correct. There had been
planned a prompt conference to follow that night’s
all-important undertaking.</p>

<p>“Been held up, Bradley,—everything’s gone
wrong!” Loveman’s usual smooth voice was now
more like a snarl.</p>

<p>“Gone wrong!” exclaimed Bradley.</p>

<p>“Yes, the whole dam’ works!”</p>

<p>“But how the hell, Loveman—”</p>

<p>“I can’t explain here,” Loveman snappily interrupted.
“It’s not safe. Clifford’s got a dictagraph
planted somewhere in this room.”</p>

<p>“The hell you say! But how do you know?”</p>

<p>“He quoted something to-night which you and I
had said—something which we said when alone
in this room.”</p>

<p>“Damn him!” growled Bradley. “Why didn’t
I go ahead, instead of minding you, and have him
bumped off when I wanted to!” And then: “Let’s
look around and rip out his damned machine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“There’s no telling where his wires run. Besides,
there’s not time. There’s a chance that he may be
trailing me here—”</p>

<p>“Come on, then,” snapped the brusque voice of
Bradley. “If he comes up, let’s croak him. Leave
your door open and we can pull him in here and do
the job. Then you can say he got into your flat and
you shot him in self-defense, thinking he was a
burglar.”</p>

<p>Voices ceased; footsteps crossed the room below.
Removing the annunciator, Clifford slipped out into
the hallway and cautiously peered down the well
of the stairway. On Loveman’s landing he saw two
shadowy, crouching figures, and in the hand of the
lawyer he saw a dim something which he knew to be
a pistol. Instinctively he drew his automatic and
waited.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed—ten minutes. The figures
below still maintained their moveless ambuscade.
Every moment Clifford expected them to turn their
suspicion and their search upwards; in that event,
with that pair in their present mood, it would mean
bullets to the finish. Clifford did not wish such a
turn to the situation, even were he to come out the
victor; he wanted to carry this case much further,
to have much more direct evidence of the practices
of the pair, before the end should come. But he held
himself tensely ready.</p>

<p>But his foresight and quick action had saved him
an encounter: the pair thought only of the possibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
that Clifford might have followed Loveman, and
never that he might have preceded Loveman here.
Presently, a low voice ascended to him—Bradley’s.</p>

<p>“Guess he’s not trailed you, Loveman. Come on,
I want the dope on what happened to-night. Clifford
can’t have your whole joint wired; let’s go into your
bathroom—he can’t have touched that.”</p>

<p>They withdrew and a moment later Clifford heard
a door close. He slipped down, waited a space at
Loveman’s door, and then, after a few moments’ manipulation
with a skeleton key, he noiselessly opened
it and softly stepped inside. The hallway was dark,
but at one end was an open door from which light
streamed. Toward this he slipped with a cat’s tread,
and peeped in. He saw the bathroom, as large as an
ordinary New York bedroom, finished in marble and
white-tile, and in it sat little Loveman and the big-chested
Bradley.</p>

<p>In a low voice Loveman briefly outlined the
fiasco of their careful scheme at Le Minuit. Bradley
swore—and Clifford was the chief object of his
guttural fury.</p>

<p>“What we goin’ to do next?”</p>

<p>“I’ve done one thing already. I beat it straight to
Mary Regan.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“She’s too good a thing to lose if we can hold
her; so I tried to con her into believing I’d framed
her for her own good. But that’s not the real reason—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
big reason.” Loveman’s usually smooth
voice was now nervous and tense. “Don’t you see
the fix she’s got me in? She knows enough about
me to get me disbarred, if she cared to talk—and
perhaps get me a prison sentence on top of it—and
perhaps get you sent away, too. So I simply
had to have her on our side, if I could get her.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did she say?”</p>

<p>“She turned me down cold—said she was through
with me.”</p>

<p>Again Bradley swore. “Well, if you’re afraid of
her, why don’t you beat her to that big stiff Morton—tell
him who she is and what she’s done? You
can get away with it.”</p>

<p>“Telling Morton has got to be my last move.
It’s too dangerous—I might implicate myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, what you going to do?”</p>

<p>“My chief business has got to be Mary Regan,”
Loveman answered grimly—“fixing her so she
can’t hurt me, and doing it quick.”</p>

<p>“You mean croaking her?”</p>

<p>“That raw stuff don’t go with me, Bradley. I’m
not so tired that I’m willing to run the risk of sitting
in the electric chair up at Sing Sing.”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of things besides being croaked
that can happen to a woman in this town,” said
Bradley. “The way that Mrs. Dormer case was
worked ain’t so bad; it’s always good for a repeat.
Mysterious disappearance until the danger
is over. You can always handle a woman so she’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
have nothing much to say about the time she was
missing.”</p>

<p>“Too risky.”</p>

<p>“How about smearing her? That would help
some, if it was done proper.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what it’s going to be yet—but
it’s going to be something mighty soon.” He spoke
with nervous incisiveness. “With you and Hilton
and Nan Burdette and Nina Cordova, there’ll be
plenty of people. Your first job will be to keep Mary
Regan covered night and day, so we can act the
minute we’re ready. I’ll have something doped out
by morning, and I’ll let you know. Come on, let’s
see if there isn’t a cold bottle in the ice-chest.”</p>

<p>Clifford stole swiftly and noiselessly out. Fifteen
minutes later he was calling his name through Mary
Regan’s door; and after a ten minutes’ wait he was
in her presence. During those minutes he had done
much thinking.</p>

<p>“Do you still control the lease to the apartment
you had in the Mordona?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p>She was bewildered. “Yes. Jack and I took it
until the first of October. Why?”</p>

<p>“Then you still have a key to the apartment?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How much baggage do you have here? Not
much, I hope.”</p>

<p>“A steamer trunk, and a bag.”</p>

<p>“Pack them. In half an hour you move back to
the Mordona.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Back to the Mordona!” she exclaimed. “What
for?”</p>

<p>He told her something of the formless danger in
which she stood. “To be safe for the present, you’ve
got to be where no one will find you. And the Mordona
is about the last place any one will look for
you. I’ll get a car from Headquarters to move you,
and you’ll leave no trail from here.”</p>

<p>There was rapid packing—a silent carrying-down
of baggage—a ride through the night in a
car that could be traced from no taxi station—and
Mary Regan was once more in the apartment in the
Mordona, where, months before, her glowing dream
had changed to a sober, patient, cautious struggle to
re-make Jack Morton into a man.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>A FATHER’S HOPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day the first open move in this struggle
was made—a minor development, perhaps signifying
no more in the unfolding of events than their
delay. Clifford learned of it when he dropped into
the Grand Alcazar the following evening on the
chance of finding Uncle George.</p>

<p>“Hello, son—sit in with me on a little drink of
this here wine drowned in seltzer,” said the old
man. And when Clifford was seated, he drawled on,
a solemn eye on his glass. “Son, I’ve been tapering
fast toward prohibition. In another month I’ll be
a bone-dry state. But I’m such a weak creature of
habit, son, that I know I’ll just keep on tapering.
I’m a worried man, and here’s what’s worrying
me: after I’ve reached water, and am still tapering,
what am I going to drink next? What’s the answer?
I tell you what, son, it’s an awful problem I got to
face single-handed and single-livered and all alone
in the world—this getting good so sudden and so
fast that I can’t stop myself. Why, man, when I
hit heaven, I’m afraid I’ll have up so much speed
that I’ll shoot clean through.”</p>

<p>Clifford made no response; he knew none was
expected. He gave solemn gaze for solemn gaze.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
Then Uncle George permitted his bald left eyelid
to droop in a slight wink.</p>

<p>“Son, I been doing a little private blood-hounding—in
my own special delicate motor-truck fashion.
The czar and the little czarovitch have fled from
the capital to Siberia.”</p>

<p>“Meaning who?”</p>

<p>“Meaning Mr. Morton and one freshly recovered
son.”</p>

<p>Clifford was at once interested. “You talked with
them?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Over at the Biltmore. The father don’t
suspect how good I am—therefore he doesn’t
mind chinning with me a bit when we meet.”</p>

<p>“Where are they going?—what are they going
to do? Did he tell you?”</p>

<p>“Son, my intellect may not be what it once was,
but a gentleman doesn’t have to tell me anything
for me to know what he’s going to do. We talked
baseball; I was willing to put two bits on the
Giants to win the pennant next season—from
which I learned that Mr. Morton was going to beat
it far from the night-blooming anemone of Broadway
and the tender folk-songs of the cabarets—and
that he was going to give his only offspring the
advantage of his direct, undivided, and unsleeping
personal attention.”</p>

<p>Clifford nodded. This fitted in with Mr. Morton’s
determination announced the night before in front
of Le Minuit when he had refused Mary’s offer—his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
cool decision that he was now going to handle
Jack. Well, he was a master at directing men, at
bending them to his will; now that he had set himself
to the task, perhaps he might also really manage
Jack.</p>

<p>Though Mr. Morton was out of the city, Clifford
privately kept watch on Mary, half expecting that
her pride and her temperish self-confidence would
get the better of her caution and impel her into that
vaguely hinted action against Jack’s father. He
tried to think out what course might be brewing in
her mind. He remembered that Mr. Morton, ignorant
of her true relationship to Jack, had tried to
make love to her—the passing love of a worldly
man; and he knew that Mary was capable of playing
any part. She might, in her desire to even matters
with Mr. Morton, and reckless of herself and
her own name, lead him on, always eluding him,
until—well, there was no guessing what Mary,
bitter and reckless, might attempt. But whatever
she might try, she would carry through.</p>

<p>Also—with the help of Lieutenant Jimmie Kelly,
and the confidential aid of Commissioner Thorne—he
privately watched Bradley and Loveman, alert
for signs of attempt to carry out their self-protecting
scheme against Mary. But Mary’s hiding was a
temporary check alike to herself and the two men,
and the next development in this complicated human
drama was to have its inception in another quarter.</p>

<p>Uneventful weeks passed; spring grew into summer;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
and then one evening Clifford was surprised
with a message from Mr. Morton asking him to call
at once at the Biltmore. Clifford went to the Biltmore,
wondering what lay behind this unexpected
summons. Mr. Morton admitted him to his sitting-room
and asked him to be seated.</p>

<p>There was a litter of mail upon the table—evidently
an accumulation of correspondence that had
not been forwarded. As Clifford sat down his eyes
were caught and sharply arrested by an open letter.
He recognized the writing—it was Mary’s; and
almost before he knew what he was doing he had
read this fragment:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been thinking your suggestion all over—and
possibly, <i>possibly</i>, if it were repeated—</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Morton, who had followed Clifford’s eyes,
reached sharply forward, and snatched up the letter.</p>

<p>“Pardon my seeing it—I couldn’t help it,” said
Clifford. And then: “I remember you offered to take
the writer of that letter on a very private cruise. I
suppose she has now consented?”</p>

<p>“That’s none of your business!” snapped Mr.
Morton, pocketing the letter.</p>

<p>So, then, Mary did have some plan under way!</p>

<p>“Mr. Clifford,” Mr. Morton said abruptly, then
paused. Clifford now perceived that the usually
composed and masterful financier was in a state of
nerves which he was trying his utmost to control.
“Mr. Clifford, some time ago I asked you to help me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
with my son. I have sent for you to ask you that
again.”</p>

<p>“Help you!” Clifford wanted a bit of information
on a certain point, so he pretended a greater ignorance
than was actually his. “Why, I supposed you
had taken Jack off, braced him up, and brought
about the marriage you once told me was your chief
desire for Jack—to Miss Maisie Jones. I supposed
Jack and she were on their honeymoon.”</p>

<p>“That affair is all off,” the father said briefly.</p>

<p>“What! Definitely?”</p>

<p>“Her aunt wrote saying that Maisie no longer
cared for Jack. I wrote to Maisie, and she confirmed
it. She was unchangeable.”</p>

<p>So, then, Maisie Jones had fulfilled her promise
to Mary.</p>

<p>“To repeat,” Mr. Morton went on, “I have sent
for you to ask you again to help me with Jack.”</p>

<p>“My answer now must be the same as when you
asked help of me before: I can’t say until I know
the situation. And even then I must reserve the
privilege to act as I think best.”</p>

<p>“All right. Have it your own way.”</p>

<p>“First, tell me what has happened since you took
charge of Jack that night at Le Minuit?”</p>

<p>“I took him to a mountain hotel in Maine, hoping
that away from all his old associates I could manage
him more easily. But he kept me awake night and
day, and even then he was always eluding me and
finding road-houses where the prohibition law didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
exist. Yesterday he got away altogether. I know
he’s somewhere in New York. I want you to help
me find him.”</p>

<p>“I thought you had Mr. Bradley retained for such
service.”</p>

<p>“I have, and I’ve already notified him. But I
don’t trust Mr. Bradley as far as I once did. That’s
why I’m asking you to help. Will you?”</p>

<p>Clifford felt the irony of it—that he should once
more be called in to save the man Mary Regan had
married instead of himself. But he nodded.</p>

<p>“That may be easy enough if Jack is in any of
the regular joy-joints. But it will be hard if any
of the sharps have got him in tow. Come on.”</p>

<p>Leading the way, Clifford began a careful search
of the gayer restaurants of Broadway. He picked
up Lieutenant Jimmie Kelly. The search was rapid,
for it had not to go beyond the entrances; Clifford
knew the door-men and managers of every resort,
and Jack Morton was a well-known figure to all. To
them Clifford put the same question—“Young
Mr. Morton in here?”—and all answered honestly,
having a very substantial fear of Clifford and Jimmie
Kelly, and an earnest desire to retain their licenses.</p>

<p>At length, toward one o’clock, they came to Le
Minuit; and of the proprietor, Monsieur Le Bain,
Clifford asked the usual question. Monsieur Le Bain
replied that Jack was there, and led the way through
the din of his “authentic Hawaiian orchestra” and
the hilarity of his hundreds of pleasure-fevered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
guests, down a little corridor off his “imperial ballroom.”
He started to open the door at the end of
this little hallway,—the door to his most exclusive
private room,—but Clifford checked his hand.</p>

<p>“Needn’t bother, Le Bain,—you can go on
back,” said Clifford. “And, Jimmie,”—to the
little lieutenant, as Le Bain went gliding away,—“I
wish you’d hang around, where you won’t be
noticed much, so you’ll be handy if needed.”</p>

<p>“All right, Bob,” returned Lieutenant Jimmie.</p>

<p>Clifford opened the door and pressed the elder
Morton ahead of him into a dining-room of gray-and-gold.
What he saw was almost the same as he
had seen in Le Minuit many weeks before: here were
Nina Cordova, Nan Burdette, Hilton, and Jack—the
only difference being that Jack, then in a stupor,
was now joyously maudlin.</p>

<p>“Why, h’lo, dad,” he said, swaying up, a handsome,
flushed, boyish figure. “Welcome home! Pull
up chair, have li’l’ ole drink, ’n’ meet m’ frien’s.
’N’ there’s Clifford—good ole scout Clifford—meet
m’ frien’s. Everybody have ’nother li’l’ ole drink.”</p>

<p>The other three had risen. “I’ll take it as a
favor if you’ll all say good-night,” Mr. Morton said
shortly. “I want to speak to my son.”</p>

<p>“So do we,” returned Nina Cordova in her most
pertly charming manner, which she figured as irresistible.
“Jack invited us to his little party, and
we’re not going to insult the dear boy by walking
out on him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“Get out—all of you!” Mr. Morton’s jaws
snapped together.</p>

<p>“See here, we don’t stand for that line of talk,
and we’re not going,” bristled Hilton.</p>

<p>Clifford caught Hilton by the wrist, and gave the
arm a twist that made the man drop sidewise to one
knee and groan. “You are all going, and, Hilton,
you go first,”—and he thrust him through the
door. He turned to Nan Burdette, and the star of
the long-faded “Orange Blossoms.” “If you two
want to avoid trouble,” he said shortly, “you’ll follow
Mr. Hilton right out.”</p>

<p>They glowered at Clifford, but started to obey.
“See here,” hiccoughed young Morton, “’f my
frien’s go, I go too,”—and he swayed toward the
door.</p>

<p>But Clifford sharply closed the door upon the
pair, blocked Jack’s way, and laid a detaining hand
upon Jack’s shoulder. “Stay with me, Jack,” he said,
“and we’ll have that little old drink together.”</p>

<p>“Don’ wan’ drink with you. Goin’ with m’
frien’s.”</p>

<p>A stubborn, vicious look had come into Jack’s
face, a look that Clifford knew meant trouble. “Just
one little old drink, Jack, and then you can go with
your friends.”</p>

<p>Jack regarded Clifford’s impeding figure, and
grinned cunningly. “All ri’—jus’ one drink.”</p>

<p>“He’s already had too damned much,” growled
the elder Morton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>Clifford gave the father an imperative, knowing
look, pushed Jack down into his chair, and pressed
a button. “Send Monsieur Le Bain,” he said to the
answering waiter; and to Jack: “I’m going to order
the drinks, Jack, and we’re going to switch to high-balls—and
we’re going to see if this dump has
some Scotch that’s really Scotch.”</p>

<p>As Le Bain appeared, Clifford stepped quickly to
the door, spoke in a low voice, and returned to the
table. Presently Le Bain himself entered with three
glasses which he set down in careful order before the
men, and then withdrew.</p>

<p>“Here’s how,” said Clifford, and sipped his glass.
Jack tossed his down and rose unsteadily.</p>

<p>“Now, guess I’ll go find m’ frien’s,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Jack,”—and Clifford pushed him
again back into place. “There’s going to be one
more round, and it’s on you. I gave Le Bain the
order.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton, not touching his glass, sharply
watched the two. Jack grinned cunningly at Clifford;
then his face became vacuous, heavy; and then
he slumped forward, and head and shoulders lay
inertly among the wine-glasses and the dishes of
the interrupted supper.</p>

<p>“What’s happened to him?” the father asked
sharply.</p>

<p>“Doped.”</p>

<p>“Doped? What for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>“Didn’t you see there was no handling him in the
mood he was in? Le Bain keeps his own knock-out
drops for use on customers who become obstreperous—and
I ordered him to fix Jack’s drink. The
dose is light—it won’t hurt him.” Clifford abruptly
changed the subject. “Well, you’ve got
Jack. What are you going to do with him?”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton did not answer; his proud, powerful
face, now pale, was fixed upon his son. Clifford also
shifted his gaze to the huddled figure. Despite
everything, Clifford really liked this good-natured
piece of driftwood which washed so irresponsibly
upon this great tide of pleasure. But what he felt
most strongly at this moment was the ironical
caprice of Destiny, which had enlarged so minor
and will-less a figure, a mere pawn in this big
human game, into so all-important a factor in Mary
Regan’s life, and his own—and in the designs of
many persons.</p>

<p>Clifford turned to the father. “Well—what
next?” he prompted.</p>

<p>“I wish to God I knew!” Mr. Morton burst out,
his reserve suddenly leaving him. “See what he’s
come to! See what he’s done to himself!”</p>

<p>“He didn’t do it—at least not all,” Clifford said
quietly.</p>

<p>“Who did, then?”</p>

<p>“Several persons—but chiefly his father.”</p>

<p>“His father!” An angry flush tinted the older
man’s cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“Jack was not unusually bad or weak, and he was
naturally most likable. He would have turned out
well enough if his father had trained him right from
the start and placed a man’s responsibilities—”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to hear any damned sermon!” the
other interrupted. “What’s done, is done! I’ve got
to face the present. I’ve done all I can to save him—and
I’ve failed!”</p>

<p>He paused, then went on in savage desperation.
“And if anything is going to be done, it’s got to be
done quick! I’ve controlled him, to an extent, by
controlling his money. But a fool aunt of his died
the other day, and left him a legacy of two hundred
thousand which automatically becomes his on his
twenty-fifth birthday—and he’ll be twenty-five in
a month. If he’s not got hold of before he gets that
money, then the last chance is gone!”</p>

<p>He was silent a moment. Then came another
burst, even more desperate.</p>

<p>“God, can’t you see what it means to me?—my
only son!—all the plans I’ve built on him!—and
him come to this! For God’s sake, isn’t there anything
that can be done to save him!”</p>

<p>Clifford regarded him steadily. But there had
suddenly begun a wild pounding of his heart.</p>

<p>“There is just one thing that might possibly save
your son.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” the other cried quickly.</p>

<p>Clifford hesitated, while the struggle which had so
swiftly arisen within himself fought itself out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>In spite of all that had happened, a dream
had persisted in him. If he spoke the thought
that was in his mind, and if that suggestion were
accepted and carried to a successful conclusion,
it would mean the end, forever, of this persistent
dream....</p>

<p>And yet—there was that plan and purpose that
had guided his attitude toward Mary Regan these
many months: that Mary should be allowed to play
her hand out—that Life should test her.</p>

<p>And then, in a flash, he was seeing again the letter
he had glimpsed when he had entered Mr. Morton’s
room at the Biltmore—that letter with its unmistakable
intimation. A flame of anger went searingly
through him. Well, given into his hands was a
method of putting Mary to the uttermost test—of
proving who and what she was: and a method of
bringing this whole matter to a head—for Mary—for
everybody.</p>

<p>“What is it, man?” Mr. Morton repeated.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t pay the price,” said Clifford.</p>

<p>“If I could get results I’d pay any price!”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure you would, but I’ll try you.”
Clifford stepped to the little wall telephone, done in
gray-and-gold to match the room, and asked for
Mary’s number at the Mordona. After a long wait
Mary’s voice sounded on the wire.</p>

<p>“This is Clifford,” he said. “I want to see you
at once at Le Minuit—very important. Ask Le
Bain to show you where I am.... All right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“Who is the party?” demanded Mr. Morton when
Clifford had hung up.</p>

<p>“I think it best for you not to know until the
party comes,” replied Clifford. “The party should
be here in half an hour.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br>

<small>HOW MARY’S DREAM CAME TRUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A tiny</span> dressing-room opened off this very private
supper-room, and into this they moved Jack and
drew the curtains. Then the two men sat down and
in a silence which had as its background the laughter
and the wild, harsh dance music without, they
smoked for half an hour—Clifford wondering how
this pale, grim man was going to bear himself, and
how, and as what, Mary would emerge from the
double situation toward which she was hurrying.</p>

<p>Presently there was a knock. “That’s our party,”
said Clifford, and crossed and opened the door.</p>

<p>But instead of Mary, there entered Bradley and
behind him little Peter Loveman. Both halted in
seeming surprise. Instinctively Clifford knew that
Hilton had sent quick warning to the pair.</p>

<p>“Been on the track of your son, Mr. Morton,”
explained Bradley; “and we just trailed him here.
Was going to shoot you word we’d located him.”</p>

<p>“You’re right on the job,” Morton said curtly.
“But since I have him in hand, I guess I won’t need
you gentlemen. Good-night.”</p>

<p>Loveman stepped quickly forward; Clifford could
guess the nervous fear that prompted the keen-witted
little man to want to be at hand in what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
sensed as a moment of peril to himself and the delicately
balanced edifice of his schemes.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Mr. Morton,” he said firmly, in a
voice of sympathetic concern, “but I’m sure we
might be of some service, and should remain.”</p>

<p>“I’m giving orders here,” snapped Mr. Morton.
“Good-night!”</p>

<p>They stood a moment, Morton’s cold gray eyes
commandingly fixed on them; then they backed
toward the door. Clifford thought rapidly: These
two, leaving here, might stumble across Mary Regan,
so long searched for by them, and prepared as he
knew they always were to act on the instant of discovery,
they might somehow manage to put their
daring plan, whatever it might be, into instant execution.
That risk must be avoided.</p>

<p>“Wait!” Clifford called sharply to them. “Mr.
Morton, I prefer to have them remain.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton stared. “Just as you like.”</p>

<p>“Loveman, Bradley, your request is granted,”
said Clifford.</p>

<p>And then a further possibility flashed upon
Clifford. Since Hilton had communicated with
Loveman and Bradley, what more likely than that
they should still be able to communicate?—which
would mean that Hilton was close at hand on the
lookout. And if that were true, what more likely
than that when Mary drove up—</p>

<p>Before this thought had completed itself Clifford
had started out. But even as he laid hand upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
knob there was a knock. He swung open the door,
and Mary, a light summer cloak thrown loosely
about her shoulders, stepped into the room.</p>

<p>“I’m here—what is it?” she said as she entered.</p>

<p>“Miss Gilmore!” exclaimed Mr. Morton, using
the name by which he had best known her.</p>

<p>She glanced swiftly and keenly from one to the
other of the three unexpected men. Then she
wheeled upon Clifford.</p>

<p>“What’s this you’ve led me into?” she demanded—“a
plant?”</p>

<p>“Bradley and Loveman are uninvited, and were
not here when I telephoned,” he explained. Then
he went on in a quiet, dominating, driving voice.
“I didn’t tell you whom you were really to meet,
and I didn’t tell Mr. Morton who was coming, for
the reason that I felt you might each refuse to see
the other. Pardon my subterfuge. But I sent for
you, Miss Gilmore, because Mr. Morton wished to
talk to you about Jack.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton flushed wrathfully. “I talk to her
about Jack! After the letter I’ve had from her!”</p>

<p>“You’ll forget that letter!” Clifford said sharply.
“You put this affair in my hands—and your chief
concern is Jack.”</p>

<p>He turned to Mary, and looked at her squarely,
meaningly.</p>

<p>“<i>You’ve</i> had your dreams—big dreams. I don’t
need to remind you what they are. And you’ve
worked to have those dreams come true.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>He turned back on Morton, and spoke in the same
dominating voice. “And <i>you</i>, Mr. Morton—I told
you a little while ago that there was just one thing
that might save Jack. Miss Gilmore here is the only
person who has in recent years had any influence on
Jack. For a time she had him working and behaving.
You recall her offer that night to take Jack
back to that Riverside Drive apartment and make
a man of him. You turned her offer down—you
said you could manage your son—and you’ve seen
the result.” He spoke more dominantly, more drivingly.
“That was your big chance. No matter what
you may think of Miss Gilmore, she is still your
big chance, and your only chance.”</p>

<p>Clifford paused and waited. Mary, very pale,
gazed at him, her lips apart. Morton, his proud,
masterful face also pale, stared fixedly at Mary, but
said nothing.</p>

<p>“Well,” Clifford prompted him sharply, “here’s
your last chance. Speak up.”</p>

<p>“First of all,” said Mr. Morton, his voice steady
with an obviously great effort and his gray eyes now
piercing, “I’d like to ask Miss Gilmore a few questions.
Miss Gilmore, how did you and Jack—”</p>

<p>“One moment!” cut in Peter Loveman, stepping
quickly between Mary and Mr. Morton, and seizing
the latter’s arm. Clifford had seen a quick fear leap
into the little man’s face, and he knew the little
lawyer’s impulse was to be first at the explaining
and save himself if possible. “I can answer what I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
know to be your questions,” Loveman said rapidly.
“That’s one reason I wanted to hunt you up to-night
with Mr. Bradley, because I’ve just learned
some things.”</p>

<p>“Loveman!” snapped Clifford, swiftly drawing
his automatic and aiming it over Mary’s shoulder.
The little lawyer turned, and all the color left the
face, ruddied by high living. “Loveman, Miss
Gilmore and Mr. Morton have the floor!”</p>

<p>Loveman, dropping Morton’s arm, stepped from
between the two. Mary had not seen what argument
had brought about the lawyer’s subsidence; her
eyes, which had shifted to Mr. Morton, had remained
steadily upon him, waiting.</p>

<p>“Mr. Morton, you have the floor,” Clifford
prompted him.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton seemed to swallow something—something
so large that it would hardly go down.
Then he spoke.</p>

<p>“Miss Gilmore, I’ve done all I can to save Jack—but
I’ve failed. The Broadway life seems to have
got him at last. Here is what he seems to have
come to.” He drew apart the curtains of the little
dressing-room, revealing the huddled form of Jack,
and then let the curtains swing together. “As Mr.
Clifford has said, I see that there is only one chance
left, and that you are the only chance. Will you be
willing to undertake what you offered to do that
night down in front of this café?”</p>

<p>The moment of Mary’s great test—her great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
opportunity, if she saw it as such—had arrived.
Clifford watched her—waiting—his whole being
taut. Her face had become a mask; she looked with
cold, direct eyes upon the man on the adroit winning
of whose favor she had for months striven to
build her great worldly dreams.</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean undertake it on the conditions
that were then mentioned,” she said quietly—“that
it is to be what you once termed the
‘usual Riverside Drive affair’? That we are to be
Mr. and Mrs. Grayson?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ll make it worth your while.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>“But I will give you any present allowance you
may desire,” he urged, “and will make any permanent
settlement upon you that is in reason.”</p>

<p>“I do not care to run—”</p>

<p>“But, Mary—Miss Gilmore,” gently interrupted
Loveman. This affair was taking an amazingly
different turn from what he had expected. After all,
bewildering as it was, matters were falling out in
a way to make his original plan seem once more
possible. “Mr. Morton’s offer is fair. Take it.”</p>

<p>Mary did not heed him, but spoke directly at
Mr. Morton. “I do not care to undertake to conduct
a sanitarium for one person for pay—and
then have the patient removed as soon as a cure is
effected.”</p>

<p>“But if you were willing to do it before, why not
now? I don’t understand!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>“It is no concern of mine if you do not understand.”</p>

<p>She spoke calmly, coldly. Clifford’s eyes were
fixed upon her, trying to pierce her brain and heart.
Morton stared at her discomfited, desperation growing
in his face. There was another moment of silence,
against the background of the dance music which
twanged stridently without.</p>

<p>Mary spoke again. “If that completes what you
wish to say to me, Mr. Morton, then good-night.”</p>

<p>She turned to leave. Her hand was on the knob,
when Morton spoke up, his voice now husky.</p>

<p>“Another minute, Miss Gilmore!” She turned
about. “Miss Gilmore, you are my last chance—and
Jack’s last chance.” He spoke more rapidly.
“I’ve simply got to have you—you understand.
You must have had some real kind of attachment
for Jack or you’d never have offered what you did.
And certainly Jack likes you or you’d never have
had the influence over him that you’ve proved you
possess. Listen—let’s consider it all from another
angle. Miss Gilmore, when you were at the Grantham
as ‘Mrs. Gardner’ you told me you had a
husband—but excuse me, I do not believe it. Miss
Gilmore”—he halted, there was a super-gulp, then
he went on—“Miss Gilmore, if you are free, I want
you to marry Jack.”</p>

<p>Clifford, Loveman, and Bradley, equally astounded,
gazed at Mary. She seemed to be able only
to stare at Mr. Morton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“Whatever I may have said or thought against
you, I’ll say this in your favor,” Mr. Morton continued,
rapidly as before—“that you were so discreet
in your affair with Jack, you kept it all so
secret, that I’m sure there will be no scandal. We’ll
not have that to face. So I ask you, as a favor, to
marry him.”</p>

<p>Clifford, still dazed by the swift manner in which
his plan had leaped beyond itself, breathlessly held
his gaze on Mary. Her dark eyes were wild, her lips
loosely parted—the figure of one bewildered beyond
realization of what had happened. Then she
caught a sharp breath and high excitement came
into her face. At that same instant Clifford saw the
magnitude of what had suddenly been opened to
her—and he saw that she was seeing it, too. At
last, by a strange twist of circumstances and of
Clifford’s attempt to guide events, she had <i>won</i>!
Won all that was included in her original plan! And
most amazing of all, what she had thought to get
as the reward of scheming, she was now being begged
to accept as a favor—wealth, worldly position,
and all that each could bring!</p>

<p>And Clifford, in this high moment, realized another
thing. All these months of her big dreams, of
her indomitable and skillful scheming, she had had
one great, ever-present fear—that some one might
expose her identity and her past, and bring to instant
nothingness her magnificent dreams. How she
had fought exposure—desperately and daringly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
with her all of cleverness! And now, if she were only
moderately careful, she need no longer fear exposure—and
when exposure came, if it did, she
would have so established herself that it could no
longer injure her.</p>

<p>Events, Clifford’s efforts, the working-out of conflicting
human impulses, the operations of that erratic
thing which we call chance or fate or destiny—all
these could not have combined more perfectly
to be her friend—could not have combined better
to bring her the worldly substance of her daring
dreams.</p>

<p>“You’ll do it, won’t you?” prompted Mr. Morton.</p>

<p>Mary did not speak at once. She was even more
pale than before; she was breathing rapidly, almost
panting, and her eyes were even more staringly wide.
Clifford, his heart pounding, wondered at her prolonged
silence—wondered feverishly just what was
passing in that bold, daring, worldly mind, which
he had found to be so many different minds.</p>

<p>She turned and gave Clifford a long, direct look—a
bewildered, almost startled look. Then she
sharply caught her breath, and slowly wheeling she
moved a step nearer Mr. Morton.</p>

<p>“Mr. Morton,” she began in a low, strained
voice, “I want to tell you something—I want to
tell you everything—”</p>

<p>“Stop!” came a frantic cry from Loveman—and
Clifford again saw fear in Loveman’s large, protuberant
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>In an instant what had been a bewildered tableau
became a whirl of activity. Bradley’s right hand
darted for the electric-light switch, and before
Clifford could move there was a click and the room
was in darkness. A shrill two notes, which Clifford
knew to be a signal, sounded from Bradley’s lips.
Clifford sprang toward where he had last seen
Bradley, and collided with that burly figure with
so great an impact that both went crashing to the
floor, Clifford on top.</p>

<p>Clifford had not drawn his automatic; he wanted
no shooting affray—not in this darkness where
bullets would be impartial and irresponsible. But
instinct told him Bradley’s probable first tactic;
and he reached for Bradley’s right hand, and fortunately
caught the wrist. Sure enough, the right
hand was jerking out a heavy pistol. With both
hands Clifford seized the weapon, and tried to twist
it from the other’s hand; and grunting, twisting,
the two old enemies fought in the darkness.</p>

<p>Clifford heard the door open and sharply close,
heard Mary cry out—and then heard another
struggle, with Mary gasping. He gave a desperate
wrench, and the pistol was his: he did not then know
that his comparatively easy victory over the powerful
Bradley was over a half-dazed man—that his
catapultic leap had driven the falling Bradley’s
head against the corner of the table. Raising the
pistol, held club-wise, Clifford twice struck at where
Bradley’s head should be. At the second blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
Bradley’s grappling arms relaxed, and he was suddenly
limp.</p>

<p>Clifford sprang to his feet, fumbled for the
switch, found it, and turned it on. Out of the blackness
there leaped before Clifford’s eyes the other
struggle, Mary Regan its center, her cloak torn loose
and slipping from one shoulder. Loveman was gripping
her left arm, and Hilton had her struggling
right arm in a twisting clutch. A tiny bright something
flashed in Hilton’s right hand and made a stab
at the white arm he held.</p>

<p>But even as this picture was revealed, Clifford
sprang toward Hilton; while Mr. Morton blinking
from the darkness, started, bewildered, toward the
two. “Look out!” warningly cried Loveman—but
too late, for as the bright fang touched Mary’s arm,
Clifford’s fist caught Hilton under the jaw. Hilton,
fairly lifted from his feet, went spinning and fell in
a loose heap. Clifford whirled upon Loveman, but
Loveman was backing away, a pasty smile on his
full face, and his hands held up.</p>

<p>“I’m not doing a thing, Bob,” gasped the little
man—“honest, not a thing!”</p>

<p>“Better keep on doing it!” said Clifford, and blew
his whistle.</p>

<p>“What’s—what’s happened?” panted Mary.</p>

<p>“Nothing—except some parties have just tried
to kidnap you, first trying to shoot a hypo into
you.”</p>

<p>“Kidnap me! What for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>“To shut you up—get you out of the way—later,
to frame you to suit their own purpose. But
you’re bleeding!” Clifford whipped out a handkerchief
and bound the arm. Then he picked up from
the floor the syringe that had fallen from Hilton’s
hand and examined it. “It’s still loaded, so you
got nothing more than a scratch of the needle.”</p>

<p>At this moment Jimmie Kelly entered, answering
Clifford’s whistle. With Jimmie’s help Clifford put
handcuffs first upon Loveman and then upon Hilton
and Bradley, who had both begun to revive.</p>

<p>“For the present, we’ll line ’em up against the
wall,” said Clifford—which they did. “Later we
can decide what to do with them.”</p>

<p>“But what’s all this about?” demanded Mr.
Morton.</p>

<p>“Explanations can wait until later,” returned
Clifford. “The first thing is your business with
Miss Gilmore. Miss Gilmore, I believe you started
to tell us something.”</p>

<p>Once more Clifford looked at Mary keenly—back
again in that mood of palpitant suspense as to
what lay in her heart—as to what she was about to
say and do—she who this moment held her dream-world
in her hands! Morton, silent, awaited her
speech. From the wall Loveman, Bradley, and
Hilton looked on in varying degrees of fear, chagrin,
and glowering wrath.</p>

<p>When at length Mary spoke, she spoke quietly.
“The first thing I wish to tell you, Mr. Morton, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
comparatively of no importance. I wrote you that
letter, yes. That was weeks ago. I wrote it the very
night you refused to entrust Jack to me. I was
angry. I was determined you should suffer, too. I
was going to lead you on—get you caught in a
predicament that would make you writhe—and
then would come public humiliation.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a predicament?” asked Mr.
Morton.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter now. But I had my plan—and
I think I could have made it work. You got
only that one letter, Mr. Morton. That was because,
when I calmed down, I changed my mind. I did not
want to do what I had planned to do.”</p>

<p>Somehow—though Mary Regan could mean
nothing in his life—this statement brought great
relief to Clifford.</p>

<p>She went on in the same quiet voice. “The rest
of what I have to tell you is of more importance.
My name is not Miss Gilmore nor Mrs. Gardner, and
never was. My name is Mary Regan. My father
was ‘Gentleman Jim’ Regan, a confidence-man;
I’ve helped my Uncle Joe Russell, another confidence-man.
I’ve been something of a confidence-woman,
a crook, in the past. Now I’m what you’d
probably call an adventuress.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Mr. Morton.</p>

<p>Clifford blinked at her, hardly believing what he
was hearing. She had feared exposure—she had
fought to ward it off—and now that she had won<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
all that she had ever dreamed of winning, here she
was quietly exposing herself!</p>

<p>“I met your son,” she went on. “I saw the chance
to get something I wanted through marrying him.
So I married him.”</p>

<p>“What—you are already married to Jack!”
ejaculated Mr. Morton. “Why—why—”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t sound believable, I know. You once
called the engagement and wedding rings fakes,
which I wore as Mrs. Grayson. I have them with
me.” From a bag which hung from her wrist she
took two rings and handed them to him. “You
may look at them. They are both engraved.”</p>

<p>He glanced at the engraving within the golden
circles.</p>

<p>“Married!” he repeated.</p>

<p>“I have been your daughter-in-law all the time
you believed me Jack’s mistress. I made him keep
the marriage secret. Jack knows nothing about who
I really am. If the marriage became public there
was the danger of you and Jack learning I was
Mary Regan; I didn’t want this to become known
until I had made myself indispensable, and then
you’d have to accept me. That’s why I tried to
make Jack settle down and go to work. It was all
part of my game.”</p>

<p>“So—you’re a crook!” breathed Morton, dumbfounded.</p>

<p>She went on in her even, controlled voice. “Also
it was part of my game to break off the affair between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
Jack and Maisie Jones—you remember that
time at the Grantham.”</p>

<p>“What—you were behind Maisie Jones’s action!”</p>

<p>“I told her that I was married to Jack, and that
we had to keep the marriage secret. And so she
wrote you, breaking the engagement. She did that
to help Jack—and help me; she didn’t know me,
didn’t understand me, therefore she overestimated
me and believed I could make a strong man out of
Jack and could make him happy. For that part of
what I did, even though it was trickery, I am glad.
Maisie Jones is too good for Jack; he would have
broken her heart. I saved her from life-long misery.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton stared. And then: “But why have
you told me all these things now?—when you had
succeeded in your plan?”</p>

<p>“Because I see things differently now,” replied
the same quiet voice. “Jack—he was attractive,
and I liked him—but I never really loved him. I am
sick of the things I tried to do, sick of the things
I dreamed of. You may have Jack’s freedom any
way you like. I’m through with it all.” She repeated
the last sentence, still quietly, but vibrantly.
“I’m through with it all!”</p>

<p>In Clifford there was wild exultation—a thrilling
sense of triumph, too new as yet for him to think
of its possible relation to himself. He had tried
to influence her by influencing the events which
touched her life—but never had he foreseen just
such a <i>dénouement</i> of events, just such a <i>dénouement</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
of character. He had been right all the while, as to
the fundamental worth of her nature!</p>

<p>Morton stared at the pale, composed face of his
daughter-in-law, which gazed with such steadiness
into his own. He was utterly without words for a
few seconds. Then he burst out:—</p>

<p>“Even if all of what you have said is true,” he
cried desperately, “you are nevertheless the one
person who can save Jack. We’ll overlook what
you’ve been and what you’ve done. You’re Jack’s
wife. Well, you’ve got to stand by him!”</p>

<p>“I’m through with it all,” she said once more.</p>

<p>Morton’s desperate, suppliant manner changed.
Once again he was the keen, powerful personality
that made him master of men and things.</p>

<p>“You can’t slide out of it like that, Mary Morton,—to
give you your right name for once,” he drove
at her grimly. “Something seems to have awakened
you—awakened you to what you regard as a real
sense of honor. Well, here is something for this new
sense of honor to consider: Whatever your motive
was in marrying Jack, in marrying him you have
incurred a definite obligation. It’s your duty, unless
you want to be a quitter, and more of a crook than
you were before, to fulfill that obligation!”</p>

<p>She looked at him fixedly—for a long time. Then
she slowly looked around at Clifford—then she
looked back again, and her figure tensed. For a long
time no one spoke.</p>

<p>“It’s an obligation you have incurred!” Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
Morton drove at her. “It’s your duty to fulfill
it!”</p>

<p>“My duty!” Her eyes grew wide, and she shivered.
Her wide eyes remained fastened in their
sickly stare upon Mr. Morton’s grim mandatory
face; she was thinking, weighing the wide alternatives
of life; influenced perhaps by the new point
Mr. Morton had made, but not influenced by his
attempted dominance.</p>

<p>“My duty!” she breathed again. Then the life
seemed to flow out of her. Her straight, slender
body drooped and swayed, but a hand clutching
the back of a gilt chair held her up. “Very well,”
she said in a thin dry whisper. And then: “Very
well—if you’ll let me tell Jack all I’ve told you,
and if Jack then still wants me.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t tell him!” cried Mr. Morton
sharply. “Even <i>your</i> hold on him is precarious.
Telling him might ruin everything. Why, I guess
you’d better not even let him know that I know.
Take him back to the Mordona—be Mr. and Mrs.
Grayson for the present—pretend to be working
toward a reconciliation with me. Keep everything
a secret until Jack is established.”</p>

<p>She smiled. The irony of it! How circumstances
had reversed their positions: here was Mr. Morton
urging almost the same arguments for secrecy that
she had formerly used upon herself!</p>

<p>It had been a very little smile. She was instantly
sober.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“Very well—I’ll keep it secret and I’ll do what
I can,” she said.</p>

<p>Clifford gazed at her heavily, a great, numb pain
where his heart was. Then he slowly turned to
Lieutenant Kelly.</p>

<p>“Let ’em all go, Jimmie,” he said briefly. “A
pinch means publicity, and publicity is just what
this situation doesn’t require.”</p>

<p>Jimmie removed the handcuffs and the three went
out, Bradley glowering vengeance as he passed.
“There’ll be a next time, you bet!” he growled.
Clifford made no reply.</p>

<p>“Mr. Morton, you go next,” Clifford said
brusquely. “You shouldn’t be found here by Jack
when he comes to—which may be any minute.
Mrs. Morton can take care of Jack. I’ll follow you
as soon as I’ve had a word with her.”</p>

<p>A moment later Clifford was alone with Mary.
He tried to keep his voice steady, but it did not
altogether obey him.</p>

<p>“I merely wanted to say that Bradley, Loveman,
and the others may not be satisfied. You exposed
yourself completely, but you exposed no one else.
You let them off easy, but they may be afraid of
you. What they tried to-night they may try again.
I wanted to ask you to be careful.”</p>

<p>“I will be,” she said.</p>

<p>“And I wanted to say that I hope everything is
going to work out for the best for you. For you
know”—he ended lamely, not very sure of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
he was saying—“I really have wanted to be your
friend.”</p>

<p>“I know you really have been my friend,” she
answered—“my best friend. And I thank you.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” she answered, in her face a drawn,
gray look.</p>

<p>For a moment he seemed unable to stir; then,
“Good-night,” he repeated, and left her, gray-faced,
and standing rigidly upright in the midst of
the débris of the evening’s carousal—to wait the
awakening of Jack.</p>

<p>Out on the sidewalk Clifford turned into a shadowy
doorway; he was going to keep watch, and from
a distance see Mary safely to the Mordona. Presently
he was aware that Loveman was at his side,
smiling his amiable smile.</p>

<p>“Clever work, Bob,” Loveman said pleasantly.
“Now that it’s all finished up, I suppose you are
satisfied with the game you’ve played.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not be satisfied till I really land you, Loveman.”</p>

<p>“No?” said Loveman, very softly. “Perhaps—who
knows?—the game may really not all be finished
up—for human nature, you know, is human
nature—and perhaps there are several other cards
to be played—several extremely good cards.”</p>

<p>With that the little lawyer moved away. Patiently,
with heaviness upon his heart, Clifford stood
motionless on guard in the doorway waiting for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
Mary to appear with her charge ... wondering now
over Loveman’s soft remark about cards yet to be
played ... now wondering about that gray, drawn
look with which Mary had followed him out....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br>

<small>JACK MAKES A RESOLUTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> an hour—two hours—Clifford continued to
stand in the shadowy doorway near the entrance
of the Midnight Café. Presently Mary came down,
Jack with her. The light drug which Clifford had
slipped into his drink to render him more manageable
and prevent his going with his carousing
companions, had spent its power. Jack was now
sober, though plainly his nerves were still badly
shaken.</p>

<p>Clifford stepped out of his doorway. He wanted
Mary to see him, that she might have the reassurance
which would come of her knowing that he was
keeping his promise to watch over her and Jack—to
ward off any possible attempt of Loveman and
Bradley—until she got Jack safely in the apartment
at the Mordona, which, months since, they
had occupied as “Mr. and Mrs. Grayson” and
which they were again to occupy under that name.
Mary saw him; but Jack also saw him, which last
Clifford had not wished for.</p>

<p>“Hello, there, Bob,—come here,” Jack called.
Clifford crossed to him, and the young man gripped
his hand in a hand that twitched. “Bob, old man,”
he went on, his unsteady voice full of feeling, “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
want to thank you. You did me a great turn—and,
old man, I’m never going to forget it. Mary told
me how you got rid of dad, and then sent for her
to take me in charge. It was great.”</p>

<p>Clifford did not look at Mary, but he was conscious
of her pale, set face. He fell in with the
apocryphal version Mary apparently had given Jack
of what had happened while he had lain in a stupor.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Jack,” Clifford replied.</p>

<p>“And say, Bob, I want you to know that I know
I’ve been a fool—and things a lot worse than that.
But, Bob,—that’s all past now—and past forever!
I don’t deserve what Mary is doing for me.
But I’m going to make good. I’m going to be a
good boy—for Mary’s sake! Just you watch me!”</p>

<p>There was a frank manliness in the young fellow’s
voice and manner. He was deeply moved, and was
as much in earnest as it lay within his powers to be.</p>

<p>“Here’s something I wish you’d back me up in,
Bob,” Jack went on. “I want to tell dad that
Mary and I are married; but she objects. Don’t
you think I should?”</p>

<p>Clifford, remembering that scene two hours back
where Mary had told the older Morton everything
while Jack lay unconscious, shook his head. “I
think she’s right, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to tell soon, no matter what
the two of you say!” He gripped Clifford’s hand
anew. “Thanks once more, old man. And remember,
I’m sure going to make good!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>They stepped into a taxi-cab. All this while Mary
had neither spoken nor looked at Clifford, and she
did not look at him now. But Clifford saw that her
face was still gray, still drawn.</p>

<p>He followed at a distance in another taxi-cab, on
the watch for interruption from Loveman or Bradley,
or their agents. But there was none; and
Jack and Mary passed out of sight into the Mordona.</p>

<p>For a space Clifford gazed after them, thinking.
Again he had a profound sense that Jack was fundamentally
a fine fellow; that what was chiefly wrong
with him was that he had been swept into the resistless
current of Big Pleasure—and that also he had
been victimized by those who make a subtle business
of playing upon the human weaknesses of
those whom Big Pleasure sucks in—and that also,
before and behind it all, he had never been properly
guided by his worldly, masterful father. Clifford
wondered whether this frank admission of
faults, this declaration to make good, was merely
a flare, merely the final spurt, of excellent qualities
that were almost spent—or whether this was in
truth the beginning of a splendid Jack Morton that
was yet to be.</p>

<p>The latter seemed to be the case. Two days later
Clifford chanced upon Mr. Morton at the Biltmore.
“Jack came back to work this morning,” commenced
the financier, “and he’s behaving as though nothing
is too hard for him. I guess I owe an awful lot to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
you for making me see that Mary was the only person
who could straighten him out. She’s a wonderful
woman! The way she’s behaved, it’s something I
cannot understand!”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to understand her,” said Clifford.
“Just try to be thankful.”</p>

<p>A new purpose had come into Clifford’s life since
that night at Le Minuit. Rather it was his old purpose,
but now more grimly determined on, and unmixed
and undeterred by other considerations. He
was out to get Loveman, and Bradley, and their
fellows—and he was also out to protect Mary.
And all this was now nothing more than a purely
professional job, since matters were as they were
with Jack and Mary.</p>

<p>Clifford’s long-prevailing reason for holding back
on Loveman and the others—that Mary might be
free to work out her plan, and that Life might have
the chance to test her—no longer had any force
with him, now that Mary had exposed herself and
renounced her ambition, now that she had nothing
at stake. His determination to get Loveman was
intensified by his certainty that Loveman was trying
to get Mary: Loveman’s soft-spoken, cryptic remark
in front of Le Minuit, about the game perhaps not
being finished, and there perhaps being other cards
to play, made him sure that this great spinner of
webs had not ceased from spinning. Clifford, putting
himself in Loveman’s place, realized that the
little lawyer had motives for the most desperate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
action. Loveman had lost Mary out of his schemes
forever; he realized that she would no longer protect
him in order to protect herself; he hated her for
having blocked him; and he feared her, feared her
daily, for she had it in her power to secure his disbarment,
to send him to prison.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in Clifford’s mind that Loveman
was planning—that Loveman would act. And
he believed that Loveman, in daily fear, would act
quickly. But what would Loveman do?</p>

<p>There was but one way to learn, and that was to
keep Loveman under constant and discreet surveillance;
and this now became the all-consuming routine
of Clifford’s life, in which he was aided by
Lieutenant Jimmie Kelly and special men supplied
him by Commissioner Thorne, and concerning which
he took counsel with Uncle George. But days,
weeks, went by; nothing happened. As far as the
closest scrutiny could reveal, Loveman was going
about his daily round of legal business and his
nightly round of pleasures, and in no way was he
concerning himself about Mary Regan. And likewise
Bradley seemed to be confining himself to his
own affairs.</p>

<p>This behavior puzzled Clifford. Why were they
holding back? But behind this seeming quiet,
Clifford knew that things were brewing—and big
things. But as to just what they might be, he
could get no clue. However, he kept doggedly at
his secret watch. There would come a time when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
they would doubtless act, and he must be ready
and on the spot to take action when the moment
came.</p>

<p>One day when Clifford was talking the situation
over with Commissioner Thorne, the Commissioner
remarked: “They’re undoubtedly up to something—and
you’ll get them in the end, Clifford.”
And then: “I hear that young Jack Morton has
braced up?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And I understand that it’s the influence of his
wife that’s keeping him in the strait and narrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>There was no further reference to Mary Regan.
But each understood what was in the other’s mind:
Thorne knew of Clifford’s regard for Mary Regan,
and Clifford knew that Thorne knew it.</p>

<p>“Clifford,” the Commissioner went on after a
moment, “I’ve twice offered you the position of
Chief of the Detective Bureau. I have a man in the
place now, but he doesn’t like it and I’m going to
shift him as soon as I can. Clifford, I’m offering
that job to you again.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Chief. I appreciate the honor”—and
he did. In former times Clifford had looked up to
that position as the glory-crowned but unattainable
peak in his professional career. He hesitated.
“It’s a mighty big thing, Chief,—but do you mind
if I don’t give you my answer until this job I’m on
is closed up?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>“All right, Clifford. But remember—I’m counting
on you.”</p>

<p>While Clifford kept at his appointed task—always
with the sense that something big was gathering,
and always wondering why Loveman was
holding back—the summer grew toward its prime.
Jack he occasionally saw; the young fellow seemed
to be keeping his promise made that night out in
front of Le Minuit. And occasionally Clifford saw
the elder Morton, who was remaining in town despite
the heat, to watch over his son in this latest
testing of Jack’s fiber. But all this while Clifford
did not again see Mary.</p>

<p>And then in the early days of August there happened
what perhaps had been inevitable this long
while—something which was perhaps, despite halts
and hopeful upward turns, merely a following of
the direction in which this affair had been foredoomed
to move since he had first come into it.
Clifford first learned of it when Mr. Morton sent for
him. He found the financier with his grim power
of control trying to repress his agitation.</p>

<p>“Day before yesterday was Jack’s twenty-fifth
birthday,” said Mr. Morton, “and Jack came into
that legacy left him by his aunt—two hundred
thousand cash, you remember. That same day it
was deposited in his name. And that same afternoon
he began drinking. He was at it yesterday; he did
not appear at the office at all. And last night he
did not go home; Mary has not seen him since yesterday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
morning. God!”—with a burst of emotion—“I
don’t like to be asking you this again—but
do what you can to find the boy!”</p>

<p>“I’ll get him if I can,” Clifford said quietly, and
went away.</p>

<p>Clifford did some quick thinking. Jack at last
might just naturally have reached the limit of the
endurance of his good resolution—yes, that probably
was the case. But even if so, the weakness of
the eaten-away structure of Jack’s will was not
alone responsible for his break-down and disappearance.
All Clifford’s instincts, and all his cold
reasoning, told him that Loveman was concerned
in this latest relapse of Jack. It was, as he well
knew, an easy matter to keep a man—either with
or against his consent—hidden in the vast human
wilderness of New York.</p>

<p>More intently, and more carefully, than before
Clifford now followed the little lawyer—about his
downtown legal work by day, about the restaurants
and roof-gardens at night. Every hour of the
twenty-four either Clifford, or the men assigned to
help him, had the little man under surveillance. As
far as eye could discern, Loveman was preserving
the established routine of his life: a figure at various
public resorts until three—then to bed—up at
eight—at his office at nine-thirty—then with his
dinner at seven beginning the round of pleasure for
the night.</p>

<p>But on the fourth evening after Jack’s disappearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
there was a slight variation. Clifford, supping
with Uncle George, whose company he found a
boon in this late-houred routine, saw Loveman
start home at a little before two, an hour earlier
than was his wont. In a taxi with Uncle George
Clifford followed Loveman’s car, saw Loveman
when he came to one of the upper West Forties,—a
street of one-time handsome residences,—slip out
of his car and walk rapidly through the quiet, deserted
cross-street. Clifford also got quickly out of
his taxi, and slipped into the dark shadow of a stoop—where
Uncle George, showing a surprising quickness,
joined him a moment later.</p>

<p>A little way down this street, before a black-windowed
house, Clifford noted two empty, shadowy
automobiles; he saw that they were alike at least in
this, that both were low and long, built evidently
for speed and the ability to maintain it.</p>

<p>Having reached this darkened and seemingly
empty house, Loveman turned and ran quickly up
the high, old-fashioned stoop. The next instant he
had let himself in with a latch-key.</p>

<p>“I suppose you know what that place is?” whispered
Uncle George, gripping Clifford’s forearm
sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes,” breathed Clifford—“the house of Joe
Le Bain!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>

<small>THE HOUSE OF MONSIEUR LE BAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur Le Bain</span>, from catering to the reckless
rich and to spendthrifts who had large sums that
abode with them for a flitting month or so, and to
monied persons about whose characters and designs
he preferred to remain safely ignorant—Monsieur
Le Bain had discovered that such as these, on occasion,
desired a greater privacy than his Grand
Alcazar or his Le Minuit or any other restaurant
afforded them—a sumptuous exclusiveness in
which, without danger of being seen by uninvited
eyes or their merry-making marred or restrained by
the propinquity of strangers, a party might dine or
sup <i>en famille</i>. Quick to see and seize opportunities,
Le Bain had devised the material equipment to
please such patronage. In addition to the Grand
Alcazar and Le Minuit, which he advertised and to
which he welcomed all, he had set up another establishment
which he did not advertise, and of
which few even knew, and to which even fewer ever
gained admission.</p>

<p>This was an old brownstone house in the upper
Forties between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, outwardly
most discreet and decorous—and, moreover, inwardly
so most of the time. The house was furnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
as a private residence, and richly furnished, too,
albeit somewhat garishly since Le Bain’s latter-day
æsthetics had been founded upon the gilt and rococo
of Broadway restaurants. There was a large drawing-room
whose windows were so deftly curtained that
no inner light ever filtered into the street; behind
that a large dining-room, in which one might be as
merry as one liked without passers-by being halted
by laugh or song—or by any possible sound of a
less happy character that might originate therein.
And in the basement there was a perfect kitchen,
which, on those occasions when the house was
briefly inhabited, Le Bain peopled with his most
efficient and reticent retainers—it being understood
that after the dinner or supper had been
served, and if the host so directed, these cooks and
waiters and ladies’ maids should vanish. And that
the party might not suffer from such withdrawal,
there was installed in the butler’s pantry an ingenious
refrigerator in which foods were kept cold and
wines properly iced—and from which host and
guests might serve themselves.</p>

<p>Such was Le Bain’s other establishment. For the
time paid for it was actually the lessee’s “home”—as
much immune from police interference as any
other man’s castle. This Le Bain would sublet possibly
two or three times a week, possibly once a
month, to some one he knew or some one with trustworthy
introduction—always at a price commensurate
with the extraordinary privacy he supplied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
And he never asked questions; particularly did Le
Bain prefer to know only the name of the renting
host—never of the guests. Then, if anything ever
happened there which got to the police,—and it
might,—Le Bain would be able to say to interrogating
officers that he maintained this place for patrons
who wished to give “home dinner parties”—surely
a legitimate business enterprise!—and he knew
nothing at all about who was there and what they
did.</p>

<p>When Peter Loveman, at two o’clock in the morning,
quickly closed the outside door, slipped along
the hallway, and then drew aside the hangings and
peered reconnoiteringly into the great dining-room
(finished as to walls and ceiling in paneled Flemish
oak, lighted by a sunlike chandelier with multitudinous
pendants), he saw just what he had expected
to see, just what he had so skillfully planned and
so adroitly manipulated. About a small, intimate
table, food-strewn and wine-stained,—a table
almost lost in this great room which could have
seated a party of fifty,—sat Nina Cordova, Nan
Burdette, Hilton, Jack Morton, and a slight, evilly
handsome third man. His people had done their
work well, exactly as per instructions, Loveman
noted: the servants had obviously been sent away,
and Jack was in the desired state of reckless and
pliable hilarity. Loveman continued to look in for
a moment, hesitating. He would have vastly preferred
not to be here—there was too much danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
for him. But his clever scheming, whose original
outline the interference of Clifford and the uncalculated
elements of human nature in Mary Regan
had thrown repeatedly into disarray, was now
nearing the culmination of what was its latest re-adjustment.</p>

<p>Loveman had held back his many-elemented new
plan—two big plans they were, in fact—because
each was dependent in a degree upon the other. He
had not dared act too quickly in the matter of
Mary, for such a course might, by some twist of
circumstances or human nature, affect Jack, and
therefore upset what he had contemplated concerning
Jack. To succeed in either he had to succeed in
both; and to succeed in both he had to synchronize
them. Whether he had done this, the hour or so
ahead was to prove.</p>

<p>Loveman frankly admitted to himself that his
affairs and his own personal safety were in a critical
condition—critical to a degree never before reached
in his career. As he now had matters planned, he
stood to win everything—or almost everything;
and also he stood to lose everything—or almost
everything. In such a crisis, where all was at stake,
he had to be on hand—despite any added risks—to
watch over, and if necessary direct, the final
moves of this his ultimate plan.</p>

<p>Loveman stepped into the great dining-room, and
stepped also into a scene that was typical of how
the forces which are behind Big Pleasure, which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
a part of it, handle those who weakly or unwarily
let themselves be carried too far by its alluring and
mighty current.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, everybody,” he called cheerily.
“Hello, Jack. This is certainly one quiet little birthday
party you’re giving.” Loveman had himself
instigated it, though these five at the table had
brought it to pass. “Kind of you to invite me,
Jack.”</p>

<p>“Got to have ole Peter—else no birthday party,”
cried Jack, swaying up and taking Loveman’s hand,
holding on to one of Nina’s with his left. “Had
three birthday parties this week; goin’ have seven
next week. Peter, y’re invited to ’em all! You
there, Slim,”—this to the slight, handsome young
man,—“get fresh bottle Pommery, open for ole
Peter Loveman.”</p>

<p>Without taking his eyes off Jack, Loveman let
them also include Nina Cordova. She gave an almost
imperceptible nod.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Jack,” said Loveman; and then in an
amiably chiding tone: “But I must say I’m surprised.
I thought you had settled down to be a
steady business man.”</p>

<p>“Damn business!”</p>

<p>“But your wife, Jack? I thought you were trying
to attend to business for her sake.”</p>

<p>Jack showed a flash of petulant ill-temper.
“Tha’s wha’ make me sore at her! Always drivin’
me to work. Always work—always business!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
Man’s got ri’ to li’l’ relaxation, ain’t he?” His good-nature
was back again. “Tell you wha’, man’s got
ri’ to do as he likes. Tell you wha’, nothin’ like bein’
free!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” put in Nina with a challenging
shrug of her dainty bare shoulders, and a
disbelieving smile. “That’s what you say—but
you wouldn’t really dare do it and be it. You see,
Peter,” with her pleasing drawl,—she was a better
actress off the stage than on it,—“this bold young
gentleman, who believes so strongly in his right to
do as he pleases, has just been trying to tell me how
much he loves me. He’s a nice little boy, Jack,—but
I don’t believe him.”</p>

<p>“But, Nina, li’l’ girl, I do love you!” protested
Jack. “Here’s Slim with tha’ champagne. Slim,
fill all glasses. Everybody ready? All ri’—here’s
Nina, only girl I love, only girl I ever goin’ love!”</p>

<p>Jack drained his glass. The others merely sipped
theirs.</p>

<p>“But drinking a glass of wine doesn’t prove anything,”
said Nina, with her pleasantly provoking
drawl. “You say you’re free, and you say you love
me—but you’re afraid really to prove it.”</p>

<p>“Not afraid!” Jack declared stoutly. “Prove it
any way you say!”</p>

<p>She gazed at him in amused skepticism—yet a
most alluring smile on her young face. “Oh, no, you
wouldn’t, Jack. There’s only one way to prove
your independence and your love. You know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
that is—to drop everything else, and go away with
me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it to-night!” he cried. “Say, listen, Nina,—know
a li’l’ place up in Adirondacks—nice,
quiet li’l’ place—”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” she interrupted. “If you took me
off into hiding, that wouldn’t prove anything. Besides,
I want to be where there’s something doing,
and where there’s people—you understand, <i>classy</i>
people.”</p>

<p>“Tha’s all ri’! Make it Newport, Bar Harbor,
any ole swell resort you like. I’m no quitter!”</p>

<p>“I believe you really are in earnest,” mused Nina,
her large eyes upon him.</p>

<p>“Sure, I’m earnest! Make it Narragansett Pier—any
ole place you like!”</p>

<p>She shook her head, and sighed. “You’re awfully
good, Jack, but it can’t be done. I’ve no clothes—and
those places take clothes—and clothes, the
right sort of clothes, they take money—and I have
no money.”</p>

<p>“Wha’s money!” Jack laughed. “Tha’s nothing!
I got money. I give you a check.”</p>

<p>“Really?”—the large, almost childish eyes still
upon him. “Yes, you really are in earnest. But one
check wouldn’t buy all I need.”</p>

<p>“You li’l’ fool—pre’ li’l’ fool,” he cried, patting
her cheek, and laughing again. “I can make it one
big check.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I don’t know anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
about checks and banks, but I know it would take
three.”</p>

<p>“All ri’,” he said good-humoredly, tickled by her
ignorance. He drew out his pocket check-book.
“How much?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Couldn’t you just sign your
name, and let me fill those spaces when I buy the
things?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Peter, you always carry ole fountain pen.
Lemme have ole fountain pen jus’ one minute.”</p>

<p>The pen was handed over. Jack signed three
checks and passed them to Nina. She murmured
warm thanks, and then looked from them to him,
apologetic doubt in her eyes.</p>

<p>“A woman’s clothes cost an awful lot, Jack,—more
than you guess. Would it be all right if I had
to fill these in for perhaps as much as five hundred
dollars apiece?”</p>

<p>Again Jack laughed. “Sure—you pre’ li’l’
fool!”</p>

<p>“You can laugh, but I want to be certain,” she
protested. “I don’t want to get in trouble by having
people come after me for having passed checks that
had no money behind them.”</p>

<p>Again Jack laughed. “’S all ri’, Nina. Listen.”
He leaned toward her confidentially. “Other day,
you know, I’m twenty-five; came into nice li’l’ ole
pile money. Soak it away in bank. Since then I buy
tha’ nice li’l’ ole car—the car I drive you up here
in, Nina—some li’l’ ole car when I turn her loose—nothin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
ever passes her—an’ I draw out li’l’ spendin’
money. Tha’s all.” He snickered once more. “Five
hundred—is my check good for tha’—oh, say!
Listen, Nina. It’s all down on stubs of my check-book—wha’
I deposit—wha’ I draw out. Look
for yourself—tha’ll show you!”</p>

<p>He handed her the check-book. She examined
the stubs, then gazed at him in stupefaction.</p>

<p>“Why!” she said breathlessly,—“why—over
one hundred and eighty-nine thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>“Sure!” He grinned delightedly. “Am I good
for five hundred—eh, Nina?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Jack. Why—I never
dreamed— Then, of course, it will be all right if I
make them as much as five hundred each.”</p>

<p>Her face broke into a sudden, naïve smile. “And
I tell you what, Jack,—I’ll make them payable to
‘Cash,’ then I won’t have to endorse them nor will
anybody else—and if anybody wants to start a
scandal, why, nobody that sees them will ever suspect,
and certainly not be able to prove, that I got
money from you. It’ll protect both of us.”</p>

<p>Nina seemed to have another inspiration—a
very business-like one. “And what’s more, I’ll just
fill these in now and have it all done with. Peter,
let me have your fountain pen. Thanks. And, Jack,
while I’m writing, you might pour me a fresh glass,
and yourself one, and one for the others—that’s a
dear boy. Remember you’re the host.”</p>

<p>While Jack was unsteadily doing a host’s duty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
decanting almost as much of the amber fluid upon
the cloth as into the glasses, Nina filled out the
checks; and as she wrote she three times repeated
aloud: “Payable to—Cash—Five—Hundred—Dollars.”</p>

<p>She returned Loveman’s pen, waved the checks
daintily until the ink had dried, then slipped them
within her sex’s invariable postal box. Loveman
glanced at his watch and rose briskly.</p>

<p>“Excuse me a minute or so,” he said. “I promised
to call up a party at two o’clock, and it’s almost
half after.”</p>

<p>He disappeared through the heavily curtained
doorway through which he had entered. The next
moment he reappeared.</p>

<p>“Nina, just as I started to use the ’phone, there
came a call for you. A woman, but she refused to
give her name.”</p>

<p>When Nina had stepped into the hall and the
heavy curtains had swung behind her, Loveman silently
held out his right hand. Also in silence Nina
reached within the bosom of her gown, drew out the
checks and handed them to him. He unfolded them,
scrutinized them sharply, refolded them, and slipped
them into an inner pocket.</p>

<p>“Nina, you certainly did it great,” he said in a
whisper. “If you were as good on the stage as you
are in a play like this, Dave Belasco would be paying
you a thousand a week. Great stuff, Nina!”</p>

<p>And then rapidly: “Go on back in. Remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
you’ve got to keep him going for two days. He
mustn’t suspect a thing, and we’ve got to keep
him out of the way until these checks go through.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” and silently that excellent off-stage
actress reëntered the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Beneath the stairway of Le Bain’s house of a hundred
precautions was an item which on occasions
helped measurably toward the ultra-private pleasures
of his guests—a telephone installed in a closet.
Loveman stepped through the door of this, closed
it, and after a wait was speaking to Mary Regan
at the Mordona—speaking in a well-mimicked
voice:—</p>

<p>“Hello.... This is Lieutenant Jimmie Kelly, of
the Tenderloin Squad,—you know, friend of Mr.
Clifford. Mr. Clifford has just found Mr. Morton—Jack
Morton, I mean. Jack is sick of what he’s been
doing the last few days—half crazy with remorse,
you understand. Mr. Clifford can’t leave Jack, and
he asked me to telephone you to come for him.
We’re all at”—here Loveman gave the address—“it’s
one of those old private houses made into an
exclusive restaurant. Just ring and I’ll let you in....
All right, then, we’ll expect you in half an hour.”</p>

<p>He called a second number, which he got instantly,
and he spoke in his natural voice, though his words
to any other ears save those at the end of the wire,
might have been enigmatic:—</p>

<p>“I wish to report a full crop,” he said. “Immediate
delivery is requested.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>With that he hung up and stepped out of the
closet, wiping away the moisture begotten by the
stifling air of the cubicle. The full-bodied little man,
that Fifth Avenue and Broadway knew best as an
amiable, unflurried smile, was now set and grim of
face, excited with suspense and calculations. All
had thus far gone well with his plan. Immediately
before him was the next vital development, swiftly
approaching its culmination. If all went there, too,
as planned—why, he would be safe—no man could
touch him—and once emerged from the desperate
methods into which his present danger had forced
him, he would be more careful in the future.</p>

<p>Resuming his amiable smile, Peter Loveman rejoined
his companions in the dining-room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br>

<small>CLIFFORD WAITS ON GUARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a minute or more, after he had seen Loveman
go up the high stoop of Le Bain’s dark-windowed
house, Clifford had stood with Uncle George in the
shadow across the deserted street and had thought
rapidly. He knew the character of that silent, respectable-fronted
residence; he had heard rumors,
vague, to be sure, of certain happenings that had
taken place within; and he had heard rumors—again
only rumors—of happenings in which unwitnessed
and unrestrained pleasure was not the dominant
purpose of the organizer of the party. He was
certain that some vital phase of Loveman’s shrewd
scheming was being, or was to be, enacted within:
Le Bain’s reticent and expensive house was not
taken for ordinary pleasures or commonplace enterprises.</p>

<p>He had to get inside, somehow; he had to know
what was happening there. Without making the
test, he knew Le Bain would have upon those two
front doors, stoop and basement, locks of a character
that it would be wasted time to try to pick or
force quietly. Of course he might get police aid, and,
ignoring such a mere detail as law, might break
down a door—but that would give the alarm to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
whoever might be within and would spoil everything.
And then he might ring the bell, and before
the person who answered could slam the door upon
him, he could drive his way through—but this
again would give alarm and would ruin everything.
The very essence of the plan forming in his mind
was to try to keep himself in the unseen background,
to discover just what Loveman and his associates
had under way, to let them carry their plan through
to its completion, and then, when he had the goods
on them, to act swiftly. That is, if he could. There
was no other way.</p>

<p>With Uncle George he reëntered the waiting taxi-cab
and hurried toward Le Minuit. On Broadway he
met two of Lieutenant Jimmie Kelly’s plain-clothes
men who were willingly impressed into his service.</p>

<p>At the blazing entrance to Le Minuit Uncle
George halted. “I guess I’ll not go up with you,
son,” he said. “I’ll do more good if I don’t openly
mess in police affairs. But I’ll hang about.”</p>

<p>Clifford nodded. With the two plain-clothes men
he mounted the wide bright stairway that led to the
Midnight Café.</p>

<p>“Tell Le Bain I want to see him in his office,” he
said to the door-man, and moved quickly among
the tables and passed through a gray-and-gilt door.
In less than a minute Le Bain entered.</p>

<p>“Joe,” Clifford began brusquely, without prelude.
“I want the key to that private house of yours, and
I want it damned quick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>Le Bain tried to look blank. “What private
house? Why, Bob, I don’t know—”</p>

<p>“Cut out the stalling!” interrupted Clifford. “It
won’t do you any good—and I’ve no time to listen
to it. I know all about that house. And you needn’t
say the people who have it to-night have the only
keys—I know you have a lot of duplicates for the
convenience of members of a party that prefer not
to go there in a group. So come across!”</p>

<p>“But, Bob, honest to God—”</p>

<p>“No time for your lies, Joe! Now, you listen to
this if you care for your own health. The people
there won’t know I got in with your consent, and
you’ll not get in bad with them. That is, unless
they are pulling something raw there—in which
case I can testify that you assisted me. On the
other hand, if you don’t come across I’ll have the
Commissioner of Licenses revoke your license for
Le Minuit within twenty-four hours, and you’ll find
you’ll never be able to do business again in this
town. Quick, now,—let’s have that key!”</p>

<p>Monsieur Le Bain, immigrant from somewhere in
that part of France which lies below Fourteenth
Street, slowly turned about and fumbled in a drawer
of his desk. He was a long time about it, but when
he finally turned there was a key in his long yellowish-white
hands. Clifford took the key, but as he did so
he caught the fading remnant of a crafty look in
Le Bain’s shifty eyes.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he said sharply, “you stick right here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
and entertain this gentleman for two hours. He can
do anything he likes except talk to people—or talk
into that telephone.”</p>

<p>Clifford caught the twitch in Le Bain’s face, and
he knew he had forestalled the other’s intent to
telephone warning to the brief tenants of the house.</p>

<p>Clifford was down in the street two minutes after
he had entered Le Minuit. Here he found Uncle
George, waiting.</p>

<p>“Hate to use you as a messenger boy, Uncle
George,” he said rapidly—“but you’re the best
possible man for the job. Mind skirmishing around
Broadway until you find Jimmie Kelly and some
more of his men?”</p>

<p>“I’m hired,” the old man replied promptly.</p>

<p>“Tell Jimmie to hang around the Knickerbocker
on the chance that I may telephone him. And you
might hang around the ’phone yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never leave it!” said Uncle George.</p>

<p>Clifford hurried from Le Minuit, and five minutes
later he was unlocking the heavy outside door, and
then the door within that, of the dark-faced house
in the upper Forties. He crept down the dim hall,
muted with Persian rugs, and soon he was gazing
through cautiously parted curtains into the oak-paneled
dining-room, and at the six celebrants of
Jack Morton’s third birthday party of that week.</p>

<p>Clifford watched and listened, every sense alert.
The last of that little scene between Jack and Nina
Cordova over the checks was being enacted: he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
Jack, laughing at the business ignorance of the
“pre’ li’l’ fool,” sign the checks and hand them
over—and he saw Nina’s scribbling pen fill them
in (before Jack’s eyes)—and he heard her slowly
repeat: “Payable to—Cash—Five—Hundred—Dollars.”</p>

<p>Clifford drew a quick breath. He understood it
all now—or thought he did. So that was what
Loveman was up to! Well, it was worth Loveman’s
while to pay almost any price for the guaranteed
privacy of Le Bain’s house!</p>

<p>The next moment Loveman was coming straight
toward him. But Clifford had already made a swift
survey of the resources of his situation; and before
Loveman was in the hallway, he was behind a pair
of tapestries at the forward end of the hall. The
space behind him was unlighted, but he sensed that
he was in the drawing-room. Peering out, he saw the
brief scene between Nina and Loveman. That little
scene convinced him that he had been correct in his
conclusion of a few minutes before as to the significance
of this affair in this house that told no secrets.</p>

<p>For a minute Clifford thought he had solved the
mystery—that he had his case complete, all except
arranging for his arrests. Then Loveman entered
the telephone booth beneath the stairway. That
was a new element. What could Loveman be about?
Clifford leaned out and strove to listen, but not one
word of Loveman’s filtered through the closet’s
sound-proof door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>Loveman left the booth and rejoined the company.
Clifford had noted a slit of light at one side
of the darkened drawing-room, and toward this he
now noiselessly made his way. The slit proved to be
a parting in the heavy curtains between the drawing-
and dining-rooms. Motionlessly Clifford watched
the group of six—and all the while he wondered
what Loveman’s telephoning could be about. There
was drinking, and banter, and reassertions of Jack’s
determination to prove himself a free spirit, and
two stumbling attempts by Jack to dance with
Nina to the music of his own singing—and thus
half an hour passed.</p>

<p>Presently there was a ring. At a word from Loveman,
the evilly handsome young man—“Slim”
Harrison, Clifford knew him to be, a crack driver of
racing-cars, and a proficient in all the evils of Broadway—rose
and left the drawing-room and passed
forward through the hallway. Clifford heard him
open the front door, and remark courteously: “Come
right in—Mr. Clifford is waiting for you.”</p>

<p>Footsteps—two pairs of them—returned down
the hallway, and then Clifford saw Slim Harrison
swing apart the other pair of tapestries, saying,
“They’re waiting for you in here.” And then stepping
into the brilliant light of the great dining-room
he saw Mary Regan.</p>

<p>Two paces within the doorway she suddenly
halted. “Where’s Mr. Clifford and Lieutenant
Kelly?” she exclaimed. Clifford saw her stiffen and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
sharply eye the group at the table. Then her gaze
fixed upon Jack, and she said quietly enough: “Jack—I’ve
come to take you home.”</p>

<p>Jack swayed uncertainly to his feet, his face sagging
with amazement. “Why—why—Mary—”</p>

<p>But Clifford heard nothing of the next few sentences.
That instant he understood it all—or
thought he did. He knew now the substance of
Loveman’s telephone message. He saw now the
magnitude of this present situation just before him.
Loveman’s great scheme—the whole of it—had
been planned and drawn together, and timed to
take place within that hour. Clifford did not yet
prevision the exact character of the further developments—but
what better place for it than Le Bain’s
house, from which no sound issued, which kept
secret all it saw and heard?</p>

<p>Swiftly, silently, Clifford slipped out into the
hallway, into the telephone closet, and closed the
sound-proof door. He got the Knickerbocker Hotel
on the wire, and a few minutes later he was snapping
out sentences to Uncle George.</p>

<p>“What, Jimmie hasn’t showed up yet!... For
God’s sake, get hold of him somehow—tell him to
come right over to Le Bain’s house—you know the
number—with three or four of his men. Something
big is going to break!—big!—you get me? And
tell him to round up Mr. Morton on the way and
see that he comes here after his son. I’ll put the
key under the doormat, so he can get in without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
disturbing any one. I want the thing to come to a
head before we act.”</p>

<p>Noiselessly Clifford crept out and hid the key.
Then noiselessly he slipped back to his post at the
curtains in the drawing-room.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br>

<small>WHEN WOMEN NEVER TALK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Regan</span> had drawn nearer the table, and pale,
her figure tense, she was gazing fixedly at Jack—waiting.
Jack was gazing back sheepishly, stubbornly,—and
Nina Cordova and Nan Burdette
and Hilton were staring at Mary in insolent triumph.
Little Loveman’s face was expressionless. Behind
her, near the doorway, ready to move swiftly, if
there was need, stood Slim Harrison.</p>

<p>At that instant Clifford realized that his supreme
interest was centered upon that trapped figure in
the next room—and that his supreme efforts would
have as their chief object the extrication of Mary
Regan from whatever crisis might be about to
develop. But at the same time Clifford realized that
his duty demanded that he hold himself in check,
and allow Loveman to reveal the details of his plan
by action, and then catch him in the act. He would
then have evidence—real evidence.</p>

<p>“Are you coming, Jack?” Mary was saying
quietly.</p>

<p>“Go on with her, Jack,” Nina Cordova taunted
him. “None of us believed you had the nerve really
to go through with what you were bragging about!”</p>

<p>“Man’s got ri’ do wha’ever he pleases—got ri’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
have li’l’ fun,” Jack said obstinately, his eyes still
fixed on Mary.</p>

<p>“Are you coming, Jack?” she repeated in the
same quiet voice.</p>

<p>He wavered. Clifford sensed that the young fellow’s
finer instincts were trying to struggle through
the murk of his being; and mixed with his disgust he
felt a pity for this likable weakling who had been
brought to this low estate.</p>

<p>“All ri’,” Jack said sullenly, and started to leave
the table.</p>

<p>“One moment, Jack,” cut in the soft, even voice
of Loveman—and Clifford saw Loveman give
Mary a quick, vindictive glance. “Before you go
with her, Jack, I think you ought to know who she is.
I only just now found out myself. Her name is Mary
Regan, all right, but she comes of a crook family,
and she herself has been a confidence-woman and
all-around adventuress. She married you solely to
do you out of your money. Ask her to deny it!”</p>

<p>“It’s true, Jack. But—”</p>

<p>“Understand now why she wanted to keep your
marriage secret?” Loveman cut in. “Plain enough:
she knew that if it were generally known that you
had married her, you would quickly learn the truth
about her and that would finish her game. And that
self-sacrifice business in letting your father believe
that she was your mistress, all in order to protect
you—can’t you see that she was really doing it to
<i>protect herself</i>, and protect her own little scheme for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
playing you along as a sucker? Want to go along with
her now, do you, so she can soak you some more?”</p>

<p>Jack, steadying himself with hands on the table,
was staring across at Mary. “’S tha’ so?” he demanded
thickly.</p>

<p>“Part of it. But, Jack, listen—”</p>

<p>“I’ll not listen! Tha’s enough!” he burst out.
He had irked at the restraints she had put upon him;
and since for him she represented the routine life,
he had unconsciously begun to weary of her. And all
the while he had been sneakingly ashamed that he
had accepted this supposed sacrifice from her. “I’ll
not go home!” he shouted across at her. “Un’erstand?
I’ll never go home! Un’erstand? I’m through
with you! Un’erstand? You crook, you—you li’l’,
dam’, sneakin’ crook!”</p>

<p>Mary stared at the inflamed, wine-flushed face
thrust toward her. Then she drew a deep breath—a
breath tense and quivering. Then a heavy voice
sounded behind her.</p>

<p>“Guess you’ve got the right dope at last, Morton,
on this Regan dame.”</p>

<p>As Mary turned quickly, Clifford’s eyes went to
the other curtained doorway. Just inside it stood
the broad, powerful figure of Bradley. So engrossed
had Clifford been in the scene between Jack and
Mary that he had not heard Bradley’s entrance—which
had doubtless been effected by one of Le
Bain’s many duplicate keys.</p>

<p>Clifford gasped within himself. The affair was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>
even bigger than he had thought a few minutes gone.
And in a flash he guessed the explanation of Bradley’s
prompt appearance upon the scene: that while
in the telephone closet Loveman had sent <i>two</i> messages—that
after getting Mary’s promise to come,
he had notified Bradley.</p>

<p>Mary looked back at Loveman, ignoring Jack.
Clifford could see that her face was very pale; but
she was straight and her gaze was unafraid.</p>

<p>“It’s no use trying to make Jack see the truth,
Peter Loveman,” she said in a slow, determined
voice. “There’s no denying that you’ve beaten
me. You have removed all my motives for keeping
silent about you. I know enough about you and can
produce enough evidence to secure your conviction
on half a dozen counts—and, believe me, Peter
Loveman, I’m going to give all that evidence to
Mr. Clifford.”</p>

<p>She turned to Bradley, and her steady voice went
on. “You were a crook when you were in the Police
Department—and you’ve been a crook, playing
every sort of crooked, double-crossing game, since
you became a private detective—and I have the
evidence on you, too, that will send you away—and
believe me, Mr. Bradley, I’m going to use it!”</p>

<p>Loveman started toward her, but Bradley checked
him with a gesture of a big hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are, are you!” he said to Mary, and
advanced until he stood squarely before her. An
ugly look had come into his face; her last words had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
fired his animal anger. “Oh, I guess you’re not,
sister!” he said with crunching grimness. “I’ve
had to hold off on you too long, but at last I’ve got
you where I want you! You ain’t going to expose
me, and you ain’t going to expose anybody else, and
you ain’t ever goin’ to hurt anybody! Do you get
me, sister?”</p>

<p>He was glowering with malignant purpose. Clifford
was wildly a-pulse with the desire to leap out
and hurl himself on Bradley. But the time had not
come; he had to wait and see the full purpose of this
night’s design.</p>

<p>“And, let me tell you, Mary Regan,” the heavy
voice gritted on, “that I’ve come here myself because
I want the personal satisfaction of attending
to you—and because I didn’t want any slip-up on
the job. And I’m going to tell you in advance
just exactly what’s going to happen to you. Why?
Because your knowing that is going to make you
suffer all the more—and, damn you, you’re going
to suffer the limit! I ain’t afraid to talk out, because
we’re all in this together!”</p>

<p>He paused a minute; then demanded: “Want to
know what’s coming to you?”</p>

<p>She stood silent, eyeing him steadily. Breathlessly
Clifford waited. Without being aware of it,
he had drawn his automatic.</p>

<p>“I ain’t going to croak you. That would be too
soft for you—it would be over too soon.”</p>

<p>“Help!” she called, with all her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>“Go to it, kid,—do it again,” encouraged
Bradley. “That’s right, Slim,”—Harrison had
caught her elbows from behind, as she had turned to
run. “I guess you’ll stand still now and hear me
through. First item, sister,—have you heard of
that necklace that was stole a week ago from one
of the rich dames that lives in the Mordona?”</p>

<p>Mary did not speak.</p>

<p>“It’s a diamond necklace,” Bradley went on.
“Worth ten thousand—mebbe twenty. I’ve got
that diamond necklace on me—never mind how I
got it. Now, as I said, the dame that lost the ice
lives in the Mordona. Also you’ve been living in
the Mordona. Also, though they’ve never hung a
case on you, the police know you’ve been a crook.
Now, that there diamond necklace is going to be
found by the police on Mary Regan. That’s item
number one.”</p>

<p>He paused to watch the effect of this upon her.
White, she looked at him unflinchingly.</p>

<p>“Here’s item number two. You see Nan Burdette,
and Hilton, and Slim Harrison,—all publicly notorious
characters,—and I know I ain’t offending
any of them when I say that if there’s any such
thing as morals, they ain’t never troubled any one
of the three o’ them. There’s a big car outside—it’s
got speed, believe me—and Slim is certainly
some driver. In about two minutes Nan and Hilton
and Slim and you start off on a joy-ride—and you’ll
be fixed so you won’t do any objecting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>Mary still gazed at him in white steadfastness.
Clifford clutched his automatic with steely tenseness.</p>

<p>“And waiting in the harbor of Greenport, out at
the end of Long Island, is a swell little motor yacht.
The crew has all been fixed. In two or three hours—Slim
here can make the run in about that time—the
four of you go aboard and begin a joy-cruise
among those islands and bays out there where
nobody is ever goin’ to bother you. In about ten
days the police will be tipped off as to who stole the
necklace and where you’re to be found—and you’ll
be pinched in this crowd here, and the necklace
found in the bottom of your bag. This bunch will
swear that you came along voluntarily—that you
really helped get up the party. And the crew will
testify how you and the others behaved—and the
bunch here will admit it. Booze all the time—Slim,
here, your special guy—the lid off everything. I
guess you get me!”</p>

<p>If she did not, Clifford did. He drew a deep
breath. It was all devilishly cunning. But tense and
excited though he was, Clifford recognized that the
situation was far larger than just this one case on
which he looked; that in a limited way it was typical.
Many a woman, in this world where he had been
working these many months, had been the victim
of kindred daring enterprises when necessary for
the safety or the projects of these subtle <i>entrepreneurs</i>
of Big Pleasure. And these women had never
dared tell what had happened to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>Bradley drove on at her. “And your being
pinched on a joy-cruise with this bunch, which will
stamp you as being the same sort of character—and
that necklace being found on you—this, with what
the police already know about you, will fix you good
and proper! Squeal all you want to on me or Loveman,
or anybody you like—you’ll be so smeared
your word won’t count for a damn with a judge or
anybody else!”</p>

<p>Terrible as it was, Clifford almost admired the
plan, so ghastly was it in its completeness, its convincingness.
He saw that Mary’s face was now
drawn, her eyes wide—saw that she was perceiving
as inescapable the cunning fate that had been
planned for her—saw that she was seeing it as a
thing beyond her ever to explain away.</p>

<p>Taut as a violin string, Clifford directed his senses
to the front of the house for an instant—listening.
Why were not Jimmie Kelly and the others on hand
to reinforce him? He was not conscious that this
scene, which had seemed so long to him, was in
reality only a few minutes in the acting.</p>

<p>When he peered back into the dining-room, Jack
was lurching toward Bradley. He halted swayingly
and pointed a finger at the detective, the man that
was in him struggling once more to rise.</p>

<p>“See here, Bradley,” he said thickly. “Tha’s no
go! I no stan’ f’r raw business like tha’!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you booze pup!” Bradley snapped at
him. “What we’re doing, we’re doing as much for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
you as anybody else. She’s always played you
rotten, ain’t she? Well, we’re just fixing her so she’ll
be showed up in public for what she really is—and
so she can’t squeeze any dough out of you, and so’s
you have it easy getting a divorce. So back up, you
boob!”</p>

<p>He glanced at the group at the table. “Get your
things on, Burdette and Hilton,” he ordered. He
turned again to Mary and her keeper: “All ready,
Slim,” he announced sharply.</p>

<p>His slow taunting of his prisoner now changed to
swiftest action. He drew from a pocket a heavy
strap which he threw in a loop over Mary’s head and
with his huge strength buckled tightly at her elbows.
In the same instant Slim seized her head from
behind, and with a fierce, practiced grip forced
a gag into her mouth, which the next instant he
tied.</p>

<p>“Where’s that cloak?” Bradley demanded. Nan
Burdette handed it to him, and he flung it about
Mary. “Slim, got your car all ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then gimme that motor-veil, Slim.” It was
handed over. “And you keep out of this, Morton,—remember
we’re doing it to help you. Just hold
her, Loveman.”</p>

<p>Nan Burdette and Hilton stepped forward and
held apart the curtains—while Jack, his face still
wine-flushed, looked on waveringly, Nina holding
his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>Bradley threw the veil over Mary’s head and began
to knot it behind. “Get ready, there, to take
her out!” he ordered sharply.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t Jimmie Kelly come?” Clifford’s
wild suspense cried within him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br>

<small>WHEN OLD FOES GET TOGETHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Clifford dared wait no longer for his reinforcements—and
he dared not shoot, with Mary standing
between him and his most-desired target,
Bradley. He sprang through the curtains, his automatic
in his right hand, and swung his left fist
mightily just beneath the ear of the unsuspecting
Slim Harrison, who went down like a dead man.</p>

<p>“Look out!” shrilled Loveman, loosening Mary’s
arm.</p>

<p>Bradley whirled about, instinctively holding Mary
before him, from whose shoulders the unloosened
cloak was falling, and from whose face the as yet
unknotted veil fell away.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” Clifford cried, as if to a squad
behind him. “Guard the front door, and round up
the whole bunch!”</p>

<p>“Beat it through the basement!” Bradley roared
to the others. And at the same instant he hurled
Mary straight at the on-coming Clifford. As she
struck Clifford, Bradley leaped upon him and
knocked his pistol flying from his hand, and then,
brushing Mary aside with a powerful sweep, he
grappled Clifford in his bear-like arms. The two
men went swaying heavily. Clifford had a brief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
vision of the others staring on nonplussed—then
they were gone, and he and Bradley were alone,
except for the limp Harrison on the floor.</p>

<p>“So it was all a bluff—those others!” Bradley
snarled at him. Exultant triumph gleamed in his
malignant face. “God, I been waiting—long
enough for this—but I’m going to get you at last!”</p>

<p>Clifford tried to struggle free: Mary must have
been taken by those others, and his every impulse
called on him to pursue. But there was no breaking
the clutch of those mighty, hate-hungry arms. He
tried only to struggle defensively, hoping for the
appearance of Jimmie Kelly—but in a few moments
he realized that if he merely tried to hold his
own against this maddened antagonist he would
swiftly be a defeated man—and that once beaten
down he would be maimed to the exhaustion of
Bradley’s fury. And then he realized and accepted
this for what it was and what it had to be: it was
that “next time” for which Bradley had often
wished—the “time” which between these two old
enemies there was no avoiding.</p>

<p>This splendid dining-room had in its time looked
upon many strange scenes, but never had it looked
upon such a scene as that which followed. In each
man—hostile always, and super-enemies since Clifford
had driven Bradley from the Police Department
by the exposure of his criminal practices—was
the same supreme desire to destroy the other,
destroy him physically—to crush him utterly with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
infuriated muscles. Grappling each other they went
staggering about the great muted room. The table,
with its champagne glasses, its silver-and-glass
épergne of terraced fruit, went toppling over. The
next moment a splendid if incongruous buhl cabinet
was a wreck and its ostentatious exhibit of cut-glass
was a thousand fragments upon the floor. And still
the two men-beasts swayed about in their destructive
fury.</p>

<p>A minute of this mad straining of muscle against
muscle, and that part of Clifford’s rage which was
unbridled madness disappeared—though the rage
itself remained. His head began to clear. He perceived
that in such an animal-like struggle as this
he was foredoomed: Bradley was the heavier and
had the greater strength. So he began to try to
break free: if he could change this to a fight with
fists, and could keep Bradley at arm’s length, there
would be a different tale, for he knew himself Bradley’s
superior at boxing. But Bradley also knew this
and clung unbreakingly on: his was the art of the
New York policeman who has risen from the “gas-house
district”—an art in which no practice that
will maim or win is barred. He kicked fiercely at
Clifford’s shins; he tried to drive his knee up into
Clifford’s stomach; suddenly bending his own body
inwardly into an arc, he as suddenly contracted
his gorilla-like arms, with the intent to disable his
enemy, caught unawares—perhaps break his back;
and he closed a huge hand upon Clifford’s face as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
though it would strip the features from the skull—and
only removed that awful grip when Clifford sunk
his teeth into the heel of the palm.</p>

<p>For the time Clifford had forgotten all but Bradley.
Had he thought of Jimmie Kelly, he would now
have resented Jimmie’s entrance.</p>

<p>All this while, whenever he could get a free arm,
and dared risk a blow, Clifford was driving his fist
into the glowering face before his own. He was not
directing his blows in the hope of a knock-out; the
range was too short for his fist to secure the crashing
power for that; but he sent his fists at the lips, at
the nose, at the eyes. He was working toward an
end, now—working with a cold mind, though with
fury unabated. He wanted those lips and nostrils
to stream blood; he wanted those eyes to puff up
and close. That of itself would not win him this
gigantic struggle, since Bradley’s great strength
would not be reduced thereby. But it might cause
Bradley to lose all self-control, and in his huge,
unguarded violence to give Clifford the opening for
which he was working and waiting.</p>

<p>Clifford’s nerves and muscles were now remembering
something of the skill that had been his when
he had been a member of his university’s champion
wrestling team. But he was carefully masking his
plan. To Bradley he was apparently fighting the
same kind of fight as his own—where brute strength
triumphed in the end. And with Clifford there was
the question whether his old skill at its best would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
avail against such superior strength as Bradley’s—and
also the question, would he get the chance to
use it?</p>

<p>At length there came a moment when Bradley
thought that he had won. He gave Clifford a supreme
bear-hug—more than once he had thus
cracked strong men’s ribs. Clifford gave a gasping
cry, his mouth fell loosely agape, his knees gave
way, and he hung a dead weight in Bradley’s arms.
Bradley was not primarily a fist-fighter, but he knew
the value of a fist at the right moment.</p>

<p>“I’ve got you now—damn you!” he gasped
fiercely, and loosened his right arm to draw back his
fist to drive it into that flaccid face for the finishing
blow.</p>

<p>But that blow was never delivered. With a lightning
swiftness Clifford wrenched free from that too-confident
left arm, half dropped to the floor—shot
swiftly up with a backward leap that placed him
behind Bradley, and as he came up his left arm
darted under Bradley’s left shoulder, and his left
hand crooked itself upon the back of Bradley’s bull
neck. And in the same instant his right hand shot
forward and caught Bradley’s right wrist.</p>

<p>Bradley gave a sneering laugh. “Want a kid’s
horseback ride, do you!” Snarling contemptuously
again, Bradley shook his heavy shoulders as a great
dog might shake its dripping ruff. But Clifford did
not fly off. Instead his body braced itself and his
arms stiffened. Bradley’s head was driven sharply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
into his chest, his right arm was drawn out straight.
He gave a grunt and set his muscles contemptuously
against this unknown maneuver. Not yet did the
man dream what was happening to him.</p>

<p>Grimly Clifford began to exert his strength, himself
wondering if he could carry this thing through.
This hold that he had upon Bradley was a hold that
he had practiced in some fractional degree of its
potentialities in friendly contests—but never had
he seen that hold used upon a human being to the
reputed limits of its effectiveness. He recalled the
avarice of this man, the brutal cunning, the ruthlessness,
the devil’s misuse of power—the thousands
he had bled financially, the unnumbered ones
he had “framed” and whose freedom he had coldly
sworn away—and Clifford was aflame with retributive
rage for all those whom this man in his might
had made suffer. It was as though the strength of
all these sufferers had been transferred into him.
Certainly he never had had such might before.
Slowly, inch by inch he drew Bradley’s right arm
back and downward—Bradley straining with outstanding
muscles and corded ligaments to withstand
the terrific leverage.</p>

<p>The right arm reached its lowest arc, then Clifford
began to bend it back and pull it up. A groan burst
from Bradley—then, “Take a chance, Slim; for
God’s sake, shoot!”</p>

<p>There was a report: a bullet grazed Clifford’s
scalp—it must have missed Bradley’s head by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
inches. Clifford, raising his set face, his eyes bulging
from his own effort, saw the dazed Slim on one elbow,
aiming at him again. He swung Bradley about, so
that his body was a better protection, and, heaving,
panting, went on drawing that straining arm up—inch
by inch.</p>

<p>Suddenly the curtains parted and Jimmie Kelly
entered, behind him three of his men, Mr. Morton
and Uncle George. Jimmie saw Slim’s pointed
weapon following the pair, waiting its chance; and
leaping in he tore it from that deadly hand.</p>

<p>“Steady, Bob,” he cried, “and I’ll get Bradley
for you!”</p>

<p>“Keep out of this!” Clifford panted hoarsely.
“I’ve got him myself.”</p>

<p>They all stood back and stared at those straining,
locked figures. The two seemed hardly to move, so
tensely was the force of one set against the force
of the other. But slowly, slowly, Clifford forced
the right arm of Bradley up behind his back. Then
summoning his all of strength, he heaved sharply
and mightily upwards, as though he was lifting the
very foundations of the house. There was a sharp
report, almost as if Slim had shot again. A cry of
agony burst from Bradley, and he went staggering
across the room, and was saved from falling only by
the embrace of one corner. Even so, he swayed on
his feet; gasping groans came from his lips; and his
right arm hung loosely at his side at a weird angle.</p>

<p>“By God!” Uncle George ejaculated slowly. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
once said that if ever anybody got Bradley, you
would be the man—and, son, you certainly did
get him!”</p>

<p>Himself reeling, struggling for breath, Clifford
gazed at the face of his enemy, pulpy and bleeding
and distorted with agony. “Yes, I got him,” he
gasped. Dizzily he walked over to Bradley. “I got
you this time, Bradley,—I got you at last!”</p>

<p>But the loose figure with the misshapen face did
not answer; as a matter of fact, Bradley did not
hear. For a moment Clifford, panting, stood gazing
on him; then his mind began to recover from the all-engrossing
fury which had accomplished and motivated
and energized this struggle. It began to return
to the larger issues.</p>

<p>He wheeled about. “Yes—I got him. Jimmie, I
think you’ll find on him that Mordona necklace.
Hand him over to a couple of your men. Yes, I got
him,” he repeated. “But I got only the body. The
brains got away—Peter Loveman.”</p>

<p>“And Jack?” eagerly put in Mr. Morton.</p>

<p>“He must have gone with Loveman—” And as
Clifford answered he was asking himself a vastly
more vital question: where was Mary Regan?</p>

<p>“But where did they go?” cried the father.
“Can’t we get him?”</p>

<p>Clifford did not reply. Already his faculties had
recovered; they were working with incredible speed,
a speed that made each thought a flash. He recalled
what he had witnessed and heard before Bradley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
had come—recalled the details of the plot with
which Bradley had taunted his victim—he totaled
them—he made his deduction.</p>

<p>He sprang across the room with new energy and
seized Slim Harrison by the collar. “They wouldn’t
have taken your car without you! You’re going to
drive <i>us</i>!—and you’re going to show us all your
machine has got! Come on, Jimmie,” he cried
sharply. “No, Jimmie, you and Uncle George go
down and look through the basement and see if
there’s signs of any of them there—and meet me
out in front! Come on, Mr. Morton!”</p>

<p>And leaving the bruised and unregarding Bradley
in charge of Jimmie’s men, Clifford hurried the
dazed Slim Harrison before him through the tapestries
and out of Le Bain’s house of luxurious silence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII<br>

<small>PLEASURE PRESENTS ITS BILL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Over</span> the black, oiled boulevard that reaches, with
many tributaries and parallels, from Manhattan’s
Fifty-ninth Street Bridge to the twin points of Long
Island, Jack Morton’s new racing roadster was
speeding eastward through the heavy three-o’clock
night—Jack at the wheel, Nina Cordova beside
him, and Loveman and Hilton in the seat behind.
The little lawyer had thought rapidly; and now,
sunk low in the soft leather, he was counting his
chances which had suddenly grown desperate, but
which he still saw as large, if only there were no
more slips and he got his share of luck. And as the
car whirred on, devouring the silent, deserted miles,
on and on went his brain, calculating his chances,
shaping the details of his new course—that brain
whose supreme and sole function was to plan—in
which function all other qualities and potentialities
of the man had become centered and concentrated,
and for which they and the body itself had come
solely to exist—that brain which would never cease
its tireless, brilliant planning until death should still
its mechanism.</p>

<p>He had revised his plans the instant Clifford had
entered the dining-room—had seen instantly what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
was his best and only way. Getting Jack where he
now sat had been simple. “Come on, Jack,—the
police will get you for this, too!” he had cried. And
Jack, befuddled with drink, and feeling that his lot
now lay with these friends, had obeyed instantly
and without question. Into Jack’s waiting car Loveman
had sharply ordered those essential to his revised
plan.</p>

<p>“You know the Long Island roads?—the way to
Greenport?” he had asked Jack after they were in
their seats.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Then make Greenport as quick as you can. Remember
that motor yacht Bradley spoke of?” He
spoke with a cunning tone of excitedly pleasant
anticipation. “We’re going to be a bunch of pirates,—going
to capture the old tub—and you and
Nina and Hilton and I are going to have a nice
little cruise and wine party all to ourselves. How’s
that?”</p>

<p>“Gre’ stuff!” had been Jack’s enthusiastic comment.</p>

<p>The wheel of his new speedster in his hands, there
automatically came on Jack an exhilarating sense
that here was another lark. It was just like so many
other parties of months and years before that had
started out hilariously from Broadway for a meteor-like
rush through the dark to distant road-houses—just
one more party, but with a thrill and excitement
that topped all others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>Even when drunk—that is, short of insensibility—Jack
was a good driver. His hands seemed to
have a peculiar brain of their own—albeit a reckless
brain. Ten minutes after leaving Le Bain’s
house they were across the bridge, and five minutes
later they were in the stretches of the boulevard;
and Jack, pointing with his toe to a lighted dial,
was chuckling to Nina:—</p>

<p>“Nice li’l’ piece junk—eh, Nina? Doin’ her li’l’
ole sixty an hour, an’ ain’t half tryin’.”</p>

<p>“But slow down at the turns, Jack. Please be
careful!”</p>

<p>“’M always careful. Never had an accident.”
He laughed mischievously. “Goin’ to show you
nice li’l’ breeze when we get out li’l’ farther—goin’
touch her up to ninety.”</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, behind them, little Loveman
was planning, planning—and acting. He drew out
a thin morocco wallet, from it took a stamped envelope,
and on this with a pencil he scrawled an address—the
address of a New York bank where he
had a personal account which was so private that
there was not a scrap among his papers to indicate
that such an account existed. Into this envelope
he slipped the three checks Nina had given him,
sealed it, placed it between the two halves of his
wallet and replaced the wallet in his coat. That
letter he would drop into a mail-box in Greenport.</p>

<p>Once on board the yacht they would make for the
ocean—he knew the vessel to be large and stanch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
enough to withstand any storm likely to arise in
summer seas—and he knew the government patrol
boats guarding the coast were not interfering with
the course of American pleasure craft. For two
days—longer if it suited the exigencies of his plan
as it worked out, and perhaps to the end of the
cruise—he would keep Jack at sea; then he would
get rid of him at some convenient port. In the meantime
Jack’s checks would have gone through Jack’s
bank. No one suspected the truth about those
checks—so he believed—and it would be a long
time before the truth came out in the routine of
business. Before that he would have managed to
draw the funds out of this secret account—just
how he did not yet see—but somehow he would
manage it. And all the while they would be cruising
southward along the coast, slipping into port when
necessary to take on oil. And finally they would
make Mexico, where Hilton would find sanctuary—and
there or in some other Latin-American State
he would start his career anew—his and Nina’s.
And evading extradition—for what charge could
be formed against him with sufficient evidence to
cause a foreign State to give it serious heed?—they
would become great people, people of brilliant position,
he and Nina.</p>

<p>For all the time that he had seemingly been
amused at her limitations and pretensions, and all
the time that he had been quite willing to fit her into
his dubious transactions, all this while Loveman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
had had one ruling thought concerning Nina—that
in the end she should be his. There had been many
women in Peter Loveman’s life, but Nina Cordova,
all of whose flaws he knew and at whom he was ever
laughing, Nina was the only woman he had ever
loved.</p>

<p>Thus, as the car spun noiselessly through the
heavy night, the shrewd, tireless brain schemed on
and on—as that brain would scheme on and on,
brilliantly, fascinated by its schemes and their working
out, until death should bring its blankness....</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the meanwhile, some miles back, another car
was spinning toward the east and toward the dawn.
But before that car had been launched on its flight
several things had happened back on Manhattan.</p>

<p>When Clifford came out of Le Bain’s house,
thrusting the scruff-held Slim Harrison before him,
and saw as he had expected that the red car belonging
to Jack was gone, an officer in uniform halted
before the high stoop. He was holding a woman by
the arm, and the woman Clifford saw to be Nan
Burdette.</p>

<p>“I saw her sneakin’ out the basement door a few
minutes ago,” explained the officer, “and as she’s a
well-known character, and as she was actin’ suspicious,
I thought I’d better see what she’d been up to.”</p>

<p>“So they dropped you, Nan,” said Clifford. “I
understand—you weren’t of use to them any
longer. But what did you hang behind for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>“None of your business,” said the woman.</p>

<p>“I guess I understand—if they were pinched
you didn’t want to get pinched with them, so you
waited to make your getaway.” Then, very sharply:
“But what did they do with Mary Regan?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she answered sullenly.</p>

<p>“Hold her, officer,” Clifford ordered. “Lieutenant
Kelly may have a definite charge against her in
the morning.”</p>

<p>Just then Jimmie Kelly and Uncle George emerged
from a shadowy doorway beneath the stoop. There
was some one between them, and at sight of this
person Clifford stepped quickly toward the two.</p>

<p>“Mary!” he ejaculated. “Mary—where were
you?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Loveman pushed me into the pantry and
locked the door.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Clifford rapidly. “Their plan against
you would now not help them—you were now just
excess baggage to them—and they merely wanted
to get you out of the way for a while.”</p>

<p>There was no time then for fuller explanations.
“We’re just starting after Loveman and Jack.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton had moved toward them. “Mary,”
he said, his voice steady only through great effort,
“I’d like to have you go along to help bring Jack
back—if Mr. Clifford doesn’t mind.”</p>

<p>She hesitated, then glanced questioningly at
Clifford. Clifford nodded.</p>

<p>“All right,” she agreed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>“Here’s where I resign,” said Uncle George—“on
the grounds that I’m too old, that I’m too
fat, that I’m not needed, and that there’s no room
for me. The best of luck to you!”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Uncle George!” And Clifford gripped
his hand.</p>

<p>They hurried into the long, low, gray car—the
car which was to have borne Mary upon that cunningly
devised saturnalia. “Jimmie, if you don’t
mind, sit in front with Slim Harrison,” said Clifford,
and himself took the rear seat with Mr. Morton,
Mary between them. He leaned forward and spoke
with harsh dominance into Slim’s ear. “Slim, I know
this is a great machine, and I know that when you
want to be you’re a great driver—and understand
this, your only chance of getting out of this affair
halfway easy is for you to get us to Greenport not
later than the car ahead. Now, turn her loose.”</p>

<p>Slim turned her loose. Once he was well across
the Fifty-ninth Street Bridge, he lived up to all that
the sporting pages had ever said in praise of his
ability. The new car, clinging tight to the glass-smooth
oiled macadam, flashed in a breath through
villages—past dimly seen summer “cottages” of
New York millionaires, grand ducal in their leisured
magnificence—and on over the motor parkway
through the humid, deserted night.</p>

<p>In the rear seat there was silence, except for the
gale begotten by the machine’s great speed. Now
and then, by the swift-passing lights of a village,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
Clifford saw the face of Mary Regan: it was pale
and set, seemed without expression, and was fixed
unchangingly ahead, not so much upon the brilliantly
illumined road before them as upon the
spaces of the night. He wondered what she was
thinking of—she who had experienced so much
these last few months, so many things that her calculations
had not foreseen. But the swiftly gone
glimpses of her white face gave him no clue....</p>

<p>And now and again Clifford saw the face of Mr.
Morton beside her. Also the face of this masterful
man of business, who ruled his thousands of men
and dominated a score of companies, and yet had
failed to direct his own son in the way he would have
him go—also Mr. Morton’s face was drawn and
pale, but it was fixed with straining impatience upon
the roadway. Now and then Clifford saw him turn
and gaze at Mary, whose forward-fixed look never
shifted, and then turn back to the road, wetting his
drawn, thinned lips....</p>

<p>All the while Clifford’s own mind was working.
The professional part of Clifford felt the exultation
of triumph already won—and the exultant excitement
of the chase, which, if successful, would make
triumph complete. He had already got Bradley; he
felt certain that he soon was to get Loveman and the
others. That much done, the dominating professional
purpose would have been achieved. He would
have won.... But there was the man element in
Clifford, and it also was thinking as the car flew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
through the night. His success meant that Loveman,
and Bradley, and Nina, and the others, who
had subtly worked to undermine whatever of good
there was in Jack, would be removed as factors
in Jack’s life—and free of their influence and
unopposedly under the influence of Mary, he and
Mary might— Well, that was the way Life worked
out. For long he had expected for himself nothing
more....</p>

<p>On, on they sped, always silent, through the
August night—the car relaxing its speed only when
there were sharp curves, and then at once picking
up its flashing pace. An hour slipped by—another
hour. They were now come upon the upper of the
two fingers into which the eastern third of Long
Island separates—and the blackness of the night
had changed into a thick, sluggish dawn, that murky
dawn held back and muffled by the heavy fogs which
lie upon the outer portions of the island on humid
days of late summer and keep the horns and sirens
of the shore at their discordant singing until noon.</p>

<p>Presently Clifford half rose in the machine and
pointed forward. “There they are!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Before them in the murk was a swiftly moving
something, now visible, now vanished in a thicker
portion of the fog. The others saw, but said nothing.</p>

<p>Clifford leaned forward and spoke into Slim’s ear.
“Just keep about this distance from them—they’ll
have to stop in Greenport and we can get them
before they can go aboard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>Slim nodded. Keeping this quarter of a mile
behind, they rushed on into the fog—flashed
through Southold—over miles of marsh-bordered
road—skirted for a space the single track of the
Long Island Railway—skimmed more miles of
marsh-bordered roadbed—swung about a curve—and
then—</p>

<p>They clutched each other, their horrified eyes
staring ahead. “My God!” gasped Clifford; and
Mary gave a sharp cry—and a wrenching groan
came from Mr. Morton. Instantly and instinctively
Slim had shut off the gas and applied the brake—and
slowly they rolled onward, staring wildly.</p>

<p>That thing which they had seen, happening all in
an instant, was a commonplace of newspaper headlines.
Long Island is a choice speeding-ground for
that tribe known as “joy-riders.” “Look out for
Crossings” reads a placard in every passenger-coach
of the Long Island Railroad—and the same placard
bears a picture of what may befall those who do not.
Jack, who had taken ten thousand risks and never
had an accident, had risked his fortune just once
too often. Driving at reckless speed, his ears filled
with the roar of the wind, he had only his eyes—and
too late had his eyes seen that freight engine
thrust itself out of the fog....</p>

<p>Clifford helped Mary out of their halted car, and
silently they all began the work of examination—soon
helped by the crew of the train. Jack’s new red
car was a tangle of twisted steel.... First they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
found Nina and Hilton; both were conscious and
crying out in their pain—each shrieked when
touched. And then they found Peter Loveman: he
was alive, but unconscious. Not far from him Mr.
Morton picked up a morocco wallet, which he slipped
into his pocket, Clifford not seeing this. And then
Clifford and Mary found Jack: he also was alive
and also unconscious. Strangely enough, his clothes
were but little disordered, and there was not a visible
scratch upon him. Lying with his pallid face
toward the sky, the hair falling back from his forehead,
he looked handsome and boyish and irresistibly
likable and endowed with qualities which go to
make an unusual man. Never to Clifford had that
face looked so promising as it now looked.</p>

<p>There is a good little hospital in Greenport, and
in half an hour the four were in it—and in less than
another half-hour two famous New York specialists
were in attendance, for many New York doctors
have summer homes near Greenport, and are professionally
connected with this little hospital. The
first report of these two men, based on a hasty
examination, was that Nina and Hilton had many
broken bones, but would undoubtedly in time be as
sound as ever; as to Jack and Loveman, a more
careful examination was necessary before they could
really tell anything.</p>

<p>There was nothing Clifford could do but merely
wait. Through an open doorway—all the patients
were on the same floor—he saw Mary Regan sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
at a window. He entered. She gave him a look
from her pale face, and without saying anything
looked back out the window. He drew a chair up
beside her, and they both sat gazing out—at the
flag with a white field and a cross of blue which
told that this little hospital had become an auxiliary
hospital of the United States Navy—and beyond
at the harbor, with its scores of small white craft,
one of which was doubtless the yacht of Loveman’s
visioned voyage—the voyage that now would
never be.</p>

<p>Neither spoke; there were no interruptions—Mr.
Morton was at Jack’s bedside, and had not left it.
Clifford felt numb: part of this was physical weariness,
part the shock of what had so swiftly happened,
and part the sense of large issues (he was not
then conscious of what they all were) that remained
still in the balance. An hour of this heavy silence
passed—two hours; Mary, with white, set face, continued
to gaze out upon the harbor of tiny ships.</p>

<p>At length Clifford rose mechanically and went
out into the corridor, and paced to and fro. Presently
he saw a nurse come from Jack’s room and
enter Loveman’s, and after a moment he saw the
doctor who was with Loveman—Dr. Peters,
Clifford knew him to be, a great nerve specialist,—emerge
followed by the two nurses and enter Jack’s
room. He noted that Loveman’s door had been left
open; and first, without purpose, merely as a break
in the routine of his walking, he paused and looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
in. Then he entered and crossed to Loveman’s
bed.</p>

<p>To his surprise Loveman’s large bright eyes were
wide open; they recognized him—and Clifford saw
that they were alive with all of Loveman’s intelligence.
He gazed down at the sheet-covered figure,
and something of the fury revived which had lain
dumb in him these last two or three hours.</p>

<p>“Well, Loveman, I’ve landed you at last!” he
said grimly.</p>

<p>The little lawyer made no response.</p>

<p>“Make no mistake about it, Loveman,—I’ve
got you for fair this time—and got you eleven
different ways from Sunday!”</p>

<p>Still the little man did not speak, though his eyes
showed that he understood every word. Clifford
was provoked at the manner in which Loveman
ignored him.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any come-back at all, Loveman—you
were usually quick enough with your tongue.”</p>

<p>“See here—what are you doing with my patient?”
a sharp voice called from the door.</p>

<p>Clifford turned. Approaching was Dr. Peters.</p>

<p>“He may be your patient, but he is my prisoner,”
Clifford returned stiffly, still under the influence of
his revived fury. But at once he was himself again.
“I beg your pardon, Dr. Peters, but this man here
is responsible for all that has happened.” And
then: “He seems to have very much of a grouch
against me—rather natural, I suppose. He wouldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
even say a word to me. What’s the matter with
him?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Dr. Peters repeated, looking
at him keenly. Then he drew Clifford aside, out
of Loveman’s hearing. “All that’s the matter with
Mr. Loveman,” he answered slowly, “is that the
accident caused a hemorrhage affecting the sensory
and motor portions of the brain causing a permanent
aphasia.”</p>

<p>“What’s that mean, doctor, in plain English?”</p>

<p>“It means that he has permanently lost the use
of legs and arms, and that he’ll never speak again.”</p>

<p>Clifford stared. “But he seems to understand!”
he cried.</p>

<p>“He understands everything. His brain is as good
as it ever was, and it will be as good as ever for perhaps
thirty years to come. But by no possibility
can he ever communicate to a second person what
that brain is thinking of.”</p>

<p>Clifford stared at the doctor, mumbled something,
and unsteadily walked out. In the corridor he leaned
against a wall and drew a deep breath. As the full
significance of the doctor’s words sank in, he was
awed, appalled. That great clear brain fated by the
momentum of a life’s habit to go on planning—never
to be able to put any of those plans into action
himself—never able to communicate a plan to an
agent or accomplice—but always planning—tirelessly
planning—for thirty years or more!...</p>

<p>After a time he straightened up and entered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
room of Hilton, who was in less pain, but who just
then hated all mankind; and with Hilton he had a
few grim, direct words. After that he had a few
words with Jimmie Kelly, who was waiting below.
Then he went back and sat down beside Mary, and
briefly he told her what had befallen Loveman.</p>

<p>Again they sat in silence, gazing out upon the
harbor. Perhaps another hour passed. Then Mr.
Morton entered. He was haggard and gray of face.
Clifford and Mary rose.</p>

<p>“Jack?” breathed Mary, moving toward him.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton seemed at first unable to speak. But
when his voice did issue, though husky and low, it
was controlled and strangely emotionless.</p>

<p>“Jack never regained consciousness,” he said.
“Jack—Jack has just died.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII<br>

<small>THE STUFF IN MARY REGAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was again a long silence. Clifford’s heart
leaped strangely at Morton’s announcement, as perhaps
hearts should not at words of death. Then
Mr. Morton spoke once more, still in the low, controlled
voice, his words and steady eyes directed at
Mary.</p>

<p>“I shall arrange to take Jack to Chicago. Since
you are his widow, of course you will come along.”
And then the emotionless voice of this hard-driving
man of great affairs broke with emotion. “And,
Mary,—I want you to come because you are my
daughter-in-law. I know now you did all a woman
could for Jack; I have come to respect you for what
you are. You are all I have—I need you, Mary.
I hardly need tell you,—since it may make little
difference to you, you are so strange,—but all I
have will go to you, and your life is to be the life of
my daughter.”</p>

<p>Mary stood staring at him, loose-lipped, and did
not speak. Clifford watched her, dazed by this last
turn of circumstances. He saw the realities and
prospects that Morton’s words had given her. She
now possessed, open and aboveboard, all that she
had ever dreamed to gain by trickery—yes, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
more! And she had it all unhampered! All these
months he had tried to make Life test her—and
Life had responded by, in the end, giving her everything!</p>

<p>Still Mary did not speak. Mr. Morton went on, a
note of urging, of reassurance, in his subdued voice:</p>

<p>“And, Mary,—whatever I may have said in the
past,—you have nothing to fear from me. You are
my daughter, and you have my respect. And you
have nothing to fear from any one else, since I know
everything.... There’s an afternoon train out of
here; we’ll be taking that, Mary.”</p>

<p>And then Mary spoke. Her voice was low, but
its tone was steady.</p>

<p>“I shall be willing—and glad—to do all I can
to help. But I cannot go with you as your daughter.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Mr. Morton. And then: “I don’t
understand.”</p>

<p>The low voice went on:—</p>

<p>“I married Jack solely to make money and gain
position. Even before last night I had decided never
to take them. And now, after what has happened,
even more can I never take them. Believe me, I
mean no offense to you, but I cannot be your
daughter-in-law.”</p>

<p>“What?” repeated Mr. Morton.</p>

<p>Clifford gazed at her, stupefied.</p>

<p>“While Jack lived my marriage to him was a
secret,” the low voice went on. “Now that he is
dead, I prefer to have it continue to remain unknown,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
if that can be managed. I think it can. If
the few who know are made to believe that I am
trying to force myself upon you, they will keep silent
out of pure malice toward me. That is, I want it to
remain unknown, unless Mr. Clifford needs my testimony
to convict in his cases.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that will be necessary,” said Clifford.
“Loveman’s case is closed. As for Bradley,
Lieutenant Kelly found that Mordona necklace on
him, and Hilton, seeing that the game is over, has
just turned State’s evidence and confessed that he
and Bradley stole it. That should be sufficient to
take care of Bradley.”</p>

<p>Mary turned again to Mr. Morton. “Then I prefer
to have it all remain as it has been—unknown.
I do not want even the profit out of this of having
Jack’s name.”</p>

<p>Then came a quick set to the jaw of this man long
accustomed to having his own way. “But I can
publicly proclaim you to be my daughter!”</p>

<p>“But you will not,” she returned quietly, “since
I ask you not to.”</p>

<p>The set look continued for a moment. Then it
relaxed.</p>

<p>“All right—just as you say.” He drew an envelope
from an inner pocket. “But if you will not
accept my fortune, you cannot escape Jack’s, for it
is this moment automatically and legally yours.”
From the envelope—it was the one Loveman had
addressed in the car—he drew out three slips of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
paper and handed them to her. “There it is—three
checks totaling one hundred and eighty thousand
dollars. And you do not need to reveal yourself
as Jack’s widow to get the money, since the checks
are made out to ‘Cash.’ All you need to do is to
deposit them.”</p>

<p>She gazed at the checks, then looked up at him.
“If Jack had had no wife, I suppose his fortune
would revert to you.”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>“You understand, I can make nothing out of this—nothing.”
Slowly she tore up the checks. “I can
be of no service to you?—or Jack?”</p>

<p>“None. Except in ways you have refused.”</p>

<p>She turned to Clifford. “Am I needed here?”</p>

<p>Clifford shook his head.</p>

<p>“Then I think I’ll be going back to town,” she
said quietly.</p>

<p>Morton held out his hand, which she took. “You
are the strangest person I ever knew,” he said
huskily. “Good-bye, Mary,—and—and God bless
you!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said his daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>She turned and went out. Clifford watched her
as she passed through the broad hospital corridor
and then disappeared down the wide stairway.</p>

<p>“Mr. Morton,” said Clifford, “I’m not needed
either—Lieutenant Kelly will remain in charge
here. I’ll be going back to the city, too.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morton gripped Clifford’s hand. “Thanks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
Clifford—and good-bye.” The habitually hard face
softened yet further, and his voice lowered. “And,
Clifford,—you’re a lucky man, if it turns out the
way I think it will!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It did. In the deepening dusk of a month later,
from an interior and out-of-the-way county seat
whose records were rarely looked over by inquisitive
eyes that had an interest in transmitting what they
saw to New York City, Clifford was driving a small
roadster at an easy pace, one passenger beside him.
A few minutes before that passenger had undergone
a change of name. In New York City, if all went
as expected, it would merely be known that she
had changed her name from Mary Regan to Mary
Clifford.</p>

<p>The marriage had been the ultimate achievement
in privacy. No one had journeyed here with them.
But one person, who had insisted on being taken
into their confidence, had appeared discreetly and
anonymously at the brief ceremony in the little
court-house—Uncle George. And after the ceremony
was over, he had kissed Mary with a simplicity,
a sincerity, a tender dignity that sophisticated,
cynical Broadway would have been amazed
to see in its favorite.</p>

<p>“Mary,”—his hands on both her shoulders, his
voice quavering a bit,—“I’m glad I’ve lived long
enough to see the daughter of one old pal, and the
niece of another old pal, definitely turn into this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
road. Yes, I’m mighty glad. It’s the only road
that’s worth traveling—and I guess I ought to
know. I know you’re going to be happy. God bless
you, my dear!”...</p>

<p>And now, as the pair moved easily through the
closing twilight, all bars at last were down between
these two—all barriers of pride, of reserve, of reticence,
of opposing wills, all the long masking of
hearts. Their souls were very close together.</p>

<p>They had been riding for several miles in silence,
both still awed by what had just taken place in
the little town behind them—when Mary spoke
softly:—</p>

<p>“You promised to tell me when—when this was
over, what you and Commissioner Thorne were
talking about this morning. Aren’t you going to
tell me what it was?”</p>

<p>“Commissioner Thorne again offered me the position
of Chief of the Detective Bureau.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“I turned it down.”</p>

<p>“It was a wonderful chance!” she exclaimed.
“You refused because of me?”</p>

<p>“No. But I thought you might think so; that’s
why I didn’t want to tell you until everything was
settled between you and me. I had thought it all
out before. It was a big job he offered me, yes,—but
primarily it was an office job, a routine, administrative
job. I wanted to be out where I would be
in contact with people and their problems; where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
instead of touching life only through the reports of
subordinates, I would touch life at first hand. I
felt that in my case I could be of more service in
such a way. You understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “And I think, perhaps,—if
you’d let me,—I could help at that kind of work.”</p>

<p>“I know you could!” said Clifford. He went on,
after a brief pause: “And we talked of something
else, Mary,—the Chief and I. He told me again
of that talk he had had with you when you went
to him almost a year ago; and, Mary,”—his voice
lowered,—“our talk became for me a searchlight
thrown backward upon all that has happened these
last few months, and especially a searchlight upon
you, Mary. You may have had many motives for
deciding against me, and for doing what you did.
But I now know there was one big motive which
I never before fully realized, and of which you
perhaps were never conscious.”</p>

<p>“And that?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You did what you did partly because you loved
me, and because you have loved me all along. You
believed that for you to marry me would injure what
you saw as a big public career for me; you thought
you were not the right wife for me. As for Jack,
you didn’t really care for him—and in the beginning
you weren’t concerned in what your action
might mean to him. But me—me you didn’t
want to hurt in any way.” He repeated himself:
“I see that clearly now—even though you did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
know it, that was one of the motives that ruled
you.”</p>

<p>“I would not dare say that in my own behalf,” she
whispered. And then she went on: “But if, after
all, I have turned out what you thought me, it is
because you believed in me so long—and because
your belief in me, and the way you handled me,
forced me to become something different.... But it
must have been hard for you—very, very hard!”</p>

<p>“It’s been a thousand times worth it all, Mary,”
he breathed, “a thousand times worth it all!”</p>

<p>He caught her hand and held it tight beneath his
on the steering-wheel—it was as though now they
were jointly steering their united lives; and they
sped on through the soft, star-blossoming night, in
the silence of full understanding, southward toward
the great city where so long they had fought each
other, and where now at the last they were to begin
to build a life together.</p>
